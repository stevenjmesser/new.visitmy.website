            "content_text": "After writing about the universal interface last November, I was surprised to see a real product take this idea further this year.Everyone was surprised by the rabbit R1 at TES 2024 and the device has sold out twice. It’s an AI-powered personal assistant that’ll do things for you, so that you don’t have to open up a website or app. Check out the introduction video.It works via a ‘Large Action Model’ which understands how websites and apps work and translates your requests (or stated intent) into actions that it performs on your behalf. For example, you can ask it to create a playlist of certain songs or Spotify or ask it to plan and book a holiday for you. (There aren’t that many use cases shared, nor a list of connected services, so I guess it’ll add more functionality as its users make requests.)This is pretty close to learned services that Projects by IF have been talking about, and AI as team-mates that Matt Webb has been looking at (link to that in my previous post).Although the video kind of pitches the device as a smartphone killer, it’s actually more of a smartphone companion. They’ve focused heavily on privacy, meaning you need to give rabbit verified and authenticated access to your chosen apps and services. You need another device to do this, so you can’t get rid of your smartphone or computer entirely.The problems I mentioned previously still seem to exist, like how you’ll confirm you want to proceed with purchases or enable new permissions for other services or users. Do you have to toggle permission for each type of action and each service? Can you do that easily based on an action category, e.g. share on social media versus make a payment? When you open this thing on day one and start using it, do you blanket-enable all actions and refine them as you go? Or do you progressively toggle each action as you come to use it, leaving all new actions blocked until enabled?You’re going to spend a lot of time enabling permissions for actions in the first few weeks, as you add new services and ask it to do new things. You’re going to have to keep that other device close to you.And what about prompt engineering? One of the examples shared in the video was asking the rabbit R1 to plan and book a holiday for you. Presumably it’s just going to put together the most probabilistic plan, like top-ranked things on TripAdvisor, Time Out, etc. And you’d have to really engineer the prompt to tweak any plans, otherwise it could just create routes and plans between popular but far-away-from-each-other amenities and attractions.If you’ve got to submit and tweak and submit and tweak the prompts over and over, surely you want to use text not voice?I feel like this is built for rich, time-poor people rather than the wider world right now. It’s definitely a toy that needs the kinks ironing out. Like Anil Dash said to me on Mastodon:  who is a person that’s an early adopter of gadgets, but is so disengaged with what they eat and where they travel, that they’ll just accept the default choices from a brand new platform that will certainly have bugs?Maybe it’s useful for common, repeatable tasks you do often. But you can get some of that out of things like Shortcuts. Right now, I can’t see this thing going deep on all the different tasks you use a smartphone or computer for.I think it’d be fun to think up scenarios where you might push this Large Action Model to its limits. for example, can I use it to  provision new machines in the cloud  write and categorise new tickets in JIRA (shudder)  renew my driving licence or apply for my passport  create and recite audio descriptions for illegally streamed sports games, or  split my shopping list and order items from whichever supermarket offers them cheapest that week?And then I realised: this thing isn’t dissimilar to the Semantic Agent that Tim Berners-Lee wrote about in 2001! That was supposed to look like this:  The entertainment system was belting out the Beatles’ “We Can Work It Out” when the phone rang. When Pete answered, his phone turned the sound down by sending a message to all the other local devices that had a volume control. His sister, Lucy, was on the line from the doctor’s office: “Mom needs to see a specialist and then has to have a series of physical therapy sessions. Biweekly or something. I’m going to have my agent set up the appointments.” Pete immediately agreed to share the chauffeuring. At the doctor’s office, Lucy instructed her Semantic Web agent through her handheld Web browser. The agent promptly retrieved the information about Mom’s prescribed treatment within a 20-mile radius of her home and with a rating of excellent or very good on trusted rating services. It then began trying to find a match between available appointment times (supplied by the agents of individual providers through their Web sites) and Pete’s and Lucy’s busy schedules.All of that relies on good standards and ontologies, a Semantic Web, which make applications meaningful to machines and other applications, so that those things can interact.But wait, didn’t we just live through 10 years of all the platforms making their applications less extensible? Reddit, Twitter and all sorts of services have made it harder for third-party applications to interact with their platforms.Unless rabbit can convince these platforms to open up access again, or work directly with the rabbit team on making and supporting extensions, rabbit’s going to find it hard to give users the value they’re craving – more automation and less hassle. And with only 48,000 units sold currently, will the big platforms be incentivised to work with rabbit soon? Or will it simply not generate enough revenue for them, especially as so many actions happen off-platform where real people can’t see adverts?It’ll be interesting to see how all this plays out, but right now the hurdle seems to be it’s not clear which services rabbit can use or whether other services are incentivised to integrate with rabbit. Which feels like a huge hurdle for rabbit to hop over.",

            "content_text": "Last week I read about how OmniPlan is ready for visionOS, the OS which powers Apple’s Vision Pro goggles headset spatial computer. It’s looking like it’ll be one of the first apps ready for the new platform. OmniPlan is a project management tool.From their post (my emphasis added):  We are pleased to share that the first Omni app on visionOS for the new Apple Vision Pro will be OmniPlan, our tool for powerful project management. With OmniPlan for Apple Vision Pro, your Gantt charts are no longer limited by the size of a physical display screen. How cool is that?Is this satire?Jokes aside, there is a real use case. Gantt charts do have their uses, and they’re still used in a lot of places where certainty is necessary (whether it’s possible or not, that’s another matter). So it’s fair to assume it’s been built to meet a real user need. The author reminisces on large Gantt charts:  Large Gantt charts have been in my life for as long as I can remember.Please, go on…  When I was young, I remember my father bringing home Gantt charts for the assembly line of the Boeing 747 in big paper rolls. Dad would spread the charts out across the carpet on the living room floor, so he could scan and study them to identify potential issues with the production plan.  When Dad found an issue with the plan, he would have to move that section of the paper up to the coffee table to make his annotations. The next morning, he would take those annotated rolls back to the office with him to talk with the team about what they would need to do to keep production on schedule.Really?! In the week where hundreds of Boeing 737 jets have been grounded and inspections have found loose bolts that weren’t installed properly, which caused a plane’s side to blow out mid-flight, we’re celebrating Gantt charts and the ability to keep to schedule? I ask again: is this satire?!To be clear: I’m not saying that person’s dad is to blame.There’s no evidence to suggest that Gantt charts caused those issues, but it does raise an important point about obsessing over delivery schedules instead of ensuring you’ve got the basics right. It was covered in a piece on BBC Radio 4’s PM programme last week (starts around the 39 minutes and 37 seconds mark). Here’s a part of the discussion.  Rory Kennedy: In our film [Downfall: The Case Against Boeing] we talked about the McDonald Douglas merger as being a seminal moment in Boeing’s history where they really started to prioritise profits over safety. And of course, as you say, the effect of that is not only the tragic loss of life with 346 people who died in the 737 Max crashes, but also for shareholders, they’ve lost a lot of money.  Evan Davis: And a sort of symptom of it, I suppose, would be moving the headquarters away from where the operations were. So all the planes have been made in Seattle, and then they move the bosses over to Chicago, and you’ve got a kind of complete detachment between what’s really going on and the C-suite, the corporate board.  Rory Kennedy: That’s right. That was also a significant event, and I think was an indicator that they’re no longer going to really be hands-on in the development and the building of these aircraft, and they’re instead going to go to their board meetings and be in large buildings and make decisions that have financial drive to them, but not necessarily are connected to the quality of the aircraft and the safety of its passengers.  Evan Davis: Sir John Kay, do you see Boeing as a case study of the phenomenon that you write about? Sort of, think about the shareholders and watch the shareholders themselves suffer thereafter?  Sir John Kay: Indeed. I think it’s one of the archetypal cases, and for me, Rory has mentioned one of the seminal moments, which was the move of the corporate headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, and they actually said at the time that it was a mistake to be too close to the operations of the company. Well, that’s one point of view.  And his predecessor as CEO – who came from McDonald Douglas, actually – said “When some people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent”. So to run like a business rather than a great engineering firm, people invest in the company because they want to make money, and it was the great engineering firm that came to dominate the global aviation market. We’ve seen where wanting to make money ended up.A great engineering firm doesn’t skip the basics, it gets safety right. A business, however, is chasing growth and more profit, which can encourage cutting corners that shouldn’t be cut.Admittedly that’s a big tangent from the original story, about OmniPlan being ready for the Vision Pro. But when you think about it, if having Gantt charts that are no longer limited by the size of a physical display screen is a contributing factor to moving the end date into the future, it could actually help ensure that people don’t skip the basics. Which is cool, actually.",

In the week where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67907011\">hundreds of Boeing 737 jets have been grounded</a> and inspections have found <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67919436\">loose bolts that weren’t installed properly</a>, which caused a plane’s side to blow out mid-flight, we’re celebrating Gantt charts and the ability to keep to schedule? I ask again: is this satire?!</p><p>To be clear: I’m not saying that person’s dad is to blame.</p><p>There’s no evidence to suggest that Gantt charts caused those issues, but it does raise an important point about obsessing over delivery schedules instead of ensuring you’ve got the basics right. It was covered in a piece on BBC Radio 4’s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001v3k2\">PM programme last week</a> (starts around the 39 minutes and 37 seconds mark). Here’s a part of the discussion.</p><blockquote>  <p><strong>Rory Kennedy:</strong> In our film [<em>Downfall: The Case Against Boeing</em>] we talked about the McDonald Douglas merger as being a seminal moment in Boeing’s history where they really started to prioritise profits over safety. And of course, as you say, the effect of that is not only the tragic loss of life with 346 people who died in the 737 Max crashes, but also for shareholders, they’ve lost a lot of money.</p>  <p><strong>Evan Davis:</strong> And a sort of symptom of it, I suppose, would be moving the headquarters away from where the operations were. So all the planes have been made in Seattle, and then they move the bosses over to Chicago, and you’ve got a kind of complete detachment between what’s really going on and the C-suite, the corporate board.</p>  <p><strong>Rory Kennedy:</strong> That’s right. That was also a significant event, and I think was an indicator that they’re no longer going to really be hands-on in the development and the building of these aircraft, and they’re instead going to go to their board meetings and be in large buildings and make decisions that have financial drive to them, but not necessarily are connected to the quality of the aircraft and the safety of its passengers.</p>  <p><strong>Evan Davis:</strong> Sir John Kay, do you see Boeing as a case study of the phenomenon that you write about? Sort of, think about the shareholders and watch the shareholders themselves suffer thereafter?</p>  <p><strong>Sir John Kay:</strong> Indeed. I think it’s one of the archetypal cases, and for me, Rory has mentioned one of the seminal moments, which was the move of the corporate headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, and they actually said at the time that it was a mistake to be too close to the operations of the company. Well, that’s one point of view.</p>  <p>And his predecessor as CEO – who came from McDonald Douglas, actually – said “When some people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent”. So to run like a business rather than a great engineering firm, people invest in the company because they want to make money, and it was the great engineering firm that came to dominate the global aviation market. We’ve seen where wanting to make money ended up.</p></blockquote><p>A great engineering firm doesn’t skip the basics, it gets safety right. A business, however, is chasing growth and more profit, which can encourage cutting corners that shouldn’t be cut.</p><p>Admittedly that’s a big tangent from the original story, about OmniPlan being ready for the Vision Pro. But when you think about it, if having Gantt charts that are no longer limited by the size of a physical display screen is a contributing factor to moving the end date into the future, it could actually <em>help</em> ensure that people don’t skip the basics. Which is cool, actually.</p>",

It’s sure is December, huh?I’ve not been tracking my tasks like usual because it’s been a chore, if I’m honest. This means I’ve done way more than what I’ll write about below. But here’s the half-remembered highlights.  Introduced our new director to the GOV.‌UK Design System: the why, how and where it makes an impact (a lot of places)  Convened a meeting of designers and developers in GDS looking at establishing principles for app design (which I’m calling an assembly, ‘working group’ is 🤢)  Took my fellow team leads through the strategic objectives for the year ahead, so that we could come up with next steps together  Collaborated on a new product model with the team leads, throwing out two-week sprints for longer cycles  Built and agreed a team leads charter  Joined the release party for GOV.‌UK Frontend v5.0.0  Wrote up our experience of bringing in a coach to help with capability development  Reviewed our accessibility strategy to see what we’d achieved and what we’d need to do in the new year  Reviewed and updated our accessibility statement, now that v5.0.0 is out  Did other bitty things in the background while the team had a firebreakCycles, not sprintsTraditional two-week sprints and Scrum provide good training wheels for teams who are new to agile, but I don’t think they work for well established or high performing teams.For research and development work (like discovery and alpha), you need a little bit longer to get your head into a domain and have time to play around making scrappy prototypes. For build work, a two-week sprint isn’t really two weeks. With all the ceremonies required for co-ordination and sharing information – which is a lot more labour-intensive in remote-first settings – you lose a couple of days with two-week sprints.Sprint goals suck too. It’s far too easy to push it along and limp from fortnight to fortnight, never really considering whether you should stop the workstream. It’s better to think about your appetite for doing something, and then to focus on getting valuable iterations out there rather than committing to a whole thing.I’m not describing this in detail because the team will likely write about it after a few months of trying out the new model, and it’s very specific to this team and its context. However, there’s a few principles that are essential:  Fixed time, variable scope  Think in iterations: vertical not horizontal slices  Each cycle ends with something shippable or showable  R&amp;D cycles end on decisions around scope  Each cycle starts with a brief, but the team can deliver it how they likeI’m pretty confident in these principles. It worked at GOV.‌UK Pay and the startup. Key enabling conditions are experienced people who are empowered and passionate about the mission, but I’m lucky to have worked on teams made up of people like that.Firebreaks for team cultureTraditionally, a firebreak is an opportunity to have some self-directed time to improve your product or service any way you want. I always really enjoyed them, it’s a chance to flex the creative muscles and scratch an itch.The only problem is that you’re still working on your product or service, and you do that all the time anyway. I’m a big believer in putting time and effort into team culture, feeding the vibes: it’s the work that makes the work work. I’m also starting to create more opportunities for teams to play together, because it recharges the batteries and builds trust.So I thought, hey, what if we spend a week playing around on team culture bits?The culture problem staring me in the face was ‘hybrid-working’. Hybrid-working is bullshit, if you ask me. It’s this sitting-on-the-fence middle ground where you don’t have to declare any opinions about how people should work or how to optimise the conditions for good work to happen. Instead, you should call yourself remote-first, define when in-office collaboration is necessary, and optimise everything else to factor in geographic distribution and asynchronous communication. (I’ve written about free-range working before but should write something else.)Anyway, one symptom of hybrid-working and not optimising conditions is that you haven’t tuned your team culture around this. In the Before Times, we lived and breathed team culture through ambient media and shared spaces. We’d put posters up on the wall. We’d huddle around a TV during standup. We’d stick things on our desks, and we’d scribble on whiteboards as part of our work.But that all happens inside tools now. Those tools look different for each person on the team, and there’s no personalisation. The sense of team unity and having a shared space becomes fractured.So several weeks ago I asked the team what we might do to rekindle that sense of unity in a way that embraces hybrid remote-first working. They came up with tons of ideas which all looked grand.Off the back of those, I wrote a brief for the firebreak: ‘Create a warm, informative and engaging onboarding experience for new team members.’ I planned a basic firebreak around that which allows people to remix and combine ideas, then split off into teams to work on their projects. And instead of ‘firebreak’ we’ve been calling it ‘creative jam week’ – jam together and have fun!On Thursday we had a show &amp; tell and the team came up with some blindingly good answers to the brief.  Team avatars that go beyond Manual of Me, emphasising the person over the work persona  A timeline of the design system, why it exists and how we got here (with scope for design history and weeknotes)  A box of stickers, posters, pamphlets and handwritten notes to welcome new joiners and make them feel a part of the crewThe beauty of what they came up with is that it combines elements of virtual realities, tangible things, shared identities, plus synchronous and asynchronous timelines.Not only will the team be able to welcome new joiners and make them feel at home, they’ve also created some stuff that brings them all closer together.Feed the vibes. Let people jam together.RunningThis has fallen off a cliff. Likely because I don’t have a goal and, to be honest, I’m just tired. I’ll work out a light schedule that’ll maintain fitness for the half-marathon in February, but I need a summer goal to build up to.

Key enabling conditions are experienced people who are empowered and passionate about the mission, but I’m lucky to have worked on teams made up of people like that.</p><h2 id=\"firebreaks-for-team-culture\">Firebreaks for team culture</h2><p>Traditionally, a <a href=\"https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/03/firebreaks-on-gov-uk/\">firebreak</a> is an opportunity to have some self-directed time to improve your product or service any way you want. I always really enjoyed them, it’s a chance to flex the creative muscles and scratch an itch.</p><p>The only problem is that you’re still working on your product or service, and you do that all the time anyway. I’m a big believer in putting time and effort into team culture, feeding the vibes: it’s the work that makes the work <em>work</em>. I’m also starting to create more opportunities for teams to play together, because it recharges the batteries and builds trust.</p><p>So I thought, hey, what if we spend a week playing around on team culture bits?</p><p>The culture problem staring me in the face was ‘hybrid-working’. Hybrid-working is bullshit, if you ask me. It’s this sitting-on-the-fence middle ground where you don’t have to declare any opinions about how people should work or how to optimise the conditions for good work to happen. Instead, you should call yourself remote-first, define when in-office collaboration is necessary, and optimise everything else to factor in geographic distribution and asynchronous communication. (I’ve written about <a href=\"/2020/11/02/free-range-future-of-work\">free-range working</a> before but should write something else.)</p><p>Anyway, one symptom of hybrid-working and not optimising conditions is that you haven’t tuned your team culture around this. In the Before Times, we lived and breathed team culture through ambient media and shared spaces. We’d put posters up on the wall. We’d huddle around a TV during standup. We’d stick things on our desks, and we’d scribble on whiteboards as part of our work.</p><p>But that all happens inside tools now. Those tools look different for each person on the team, and there’s no personalisation. The sense of team unity and having a shared space becomes fractured.</p><p>So several weeks ago I asked the team what we might do to rekindle that sense of unity in a way that embraces <del>hybrid</del> remote-first working. They came up with tons of ideas which all looked grand.</p><p>Off the back of those, I wrote a brief for the firebreak: ‘Create a warm, informative and engaging onboarding experience for new team members.’ I planned a basic firebreak around that which allows people to remix and combine ideas, then split off into teams to work on their projects. And instead of ‘firebreak’ we’ve been calling it ‘creative jam week’ – <a href=\"/2023/09/18/jam-together\">jam together</a> and have fun!</p><p>On Thursday we had a show &amp; tell and the team came up with some blindingly good answers to the brief.</p><ul>  <li>Team avatars that go beyond Manual of Me, emphasising the person over the work persona</li>  <li>A timeline of the design system, why it exists and how we got here (with scope for design history and weeknotes)</li>  <li>A box of stickers, posters, pamphlets and handwritten notes to welcome new joiners and make them feel a part of the crew</li></ul><p>The beauty of what they came up with is that it combines elements of virtual realities, tangible things, shared identities, plus synchronous and asynchronous timelines.</p><p>Not only will the team be able to welcome new joiners and make them feel at home, they’ve also created some stuff that brings them all closer together.</p><p>Feed the vibes. Let people jam together.</p><h2 id=\"running\">Running</h2><p>This has fallen off a cliff. Likely because I don’t have a goal and, to be honest, I’m just tired. I’ll work out a light schedule that’ll maintain fitness for the half-marathon in February, but I need a summer goal to build up to. I’ll make a plan for running between the bothies in Eryri.</p><h2 id=\"paris\">Paris</h2><p>We didn’t have a bad meal in Paris – except a cold hot dog at La Defense Arena watching Harlequins beat Racing 92 – so here’s all the places we went that you should try too.</p><ul>  <li>Café Les Deux Gares, 2 Rue des Deux Gares</li>  <li>Le Cadoret, 1 Rue Pradier</li>  <li>Bouche, 85 Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud</li>  <li>Willi’s Wine Bar, 13 Rue des Petits Champs</li></ul><h2 id=\"bookmarks\">Bookmarks</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"http://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#atom-everything\">The AI trust crisis</a>, 7 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fec3572-1186-4c45-88df-221243ee9997\">As God is my witness, gluttony is not a sin</a>, 9 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7731011-f59d-44d8-94c4-02057385de51\">Does the Enlightenment still matter?</a>, 8 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://scifiinterfaces.com/2023/12/11/hackers/\">Hackers (1995)</a>, 15 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.decanter.com/features/a-day-in-the-life-with-mark-williamson-248880/\">A day in the life with Mark Williamson</a>, 3 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/how-an-english-upstart-changed-parisian-wine-bars-for-ever-1.4654322\">How an English upstart changed Parisian wine bars ‘for ever’</a>, 4 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://benholliday.com/2023/11/28/hold-it-lightly/\">Hold it lightly</a>, 3 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3RxMlkD\">The economics of chicken-shop Britain</a>, 9 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.dxw.com/2023/12/service-delivery-is-broken-its-time-to-join-it-up/\">Service delivery is broken – it’s time to join it up</a>, 6 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://on.ft.com/41aHGIx\">What Kwasi Kwarteng knows now</a>, 3 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.svpg.com/alternatives-to-product-leaders/?trk=feed_main-feed-card_reshare_feed-article-content\">Alternatives To Product Leaders</a>, 6 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://benholliday.com/2023/12/03/an-example-of-good-ux-not-being-good-enough/\">An example of ‘good’ UX not being good enough</a>, 4 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/2023-12-03/\">Loss</a>, 2 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://whitehallwebby.com/2023/12/01/weeknote-zero-day-one/\">Weeknote zero, day one</a>, 2 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://flocrivello.com/you-must-fuck-around-and-find-out/\">You Must Fuck Around and Find Out</a>, 2 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/30/trump-dictator-2024-election-robert-kagan/\">Opinion A Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable.

            "content_text": "Two weeks ago I ran a session on prototyping at Product for the People in Manchester. I wanted to find out how teams were using prototyping as a practice, and how it fit into their product design and development models.About 50 people turned up on the day and people from 10 teams joined my session. This gave me the chance to do some scrappy research and pick up signals, find threads we might want to pull in a more dedicated study. It took me about 3 minutes to plan and 45 minutes to run, which is dirt cheap. But it means that any other research we might decide to run can be more targeted and focus on exactly what we need to learn.I asked the teams  what tools they were using  who got involved  what stages of design and development they used the tools  what was good about it, and  what was bad about it.HeadlinesAll teams used a mix of tools, except one team who only used Figma. 80% of teams used Figma. 70% of teams used Miro or Mural. 40% of teams used the GOV.‌UK Prototype Kit. 50% of teams used paper prototypes, which I was delighted to hear! A couple of teams used Powerpoint. Some folks built scrappy technical prototypes or edited existing services in the browser’s developer tools.Designers were always involved in prototyping, but only half the teams got developers involved. That wasn’t always dependent on whether the team used Prototype Kit or other technical methods, which suggests it’s down to another factor.A few teams were very mature in their prototyping practices. When they needed to move fast, try out loads of ideas and surface issues quickly, they used low-fidelity prototypes in paper, Powerpoint, and Mural or Miro. These helped them test out different journeys and flows. They progressed to Figma and Prototype Kit when they needed more fidelity or to test out technical approaches.Figma can be complicated but is worth learning and using, as prototypes can be iterated quickly and easily. Prototype Kit has a steeper learning curve but is more functional, feels more real.Teams using paper prototyping did so as a way to get non-digital colleagues from Policy and Communications involved. Usually those people would suggest approaches that couldn’t be implemented, helping the team catch and explain those assumptions early.Two teams went beyond the interaction and technical layers to prototype the operations layer of a service too, using Lean techniques like Wizard of Oz and Concierge.Stakeholders like to see a ‘real’ thing, they struggle to make the leaps of imagination required to comprehend low-fidelity prototypes. However, they sometimes find clickable prototypes too real, not understanding that the finished thing may still change or will take a while to build properly.My personal highlightOne team asked if there could be a print-out-and-cut-out version of GOV.‌UK Design System for paper prototyping. I love that idea!So what?  Like I said, this was scrappy research and it’s not massively reliable data. But I’d safely bet on all this being sensible and worthwhile to do.I had a hunch that Figma was being used by the majority of teams, so it’s good to have uncovered that thread. If all the departments building the Top 75 services use Figma, I’d say it’d be worth GDS investing in an officially supported Figma component library, kept up-to-date with GOV.‌UK Design System.Only one team mentioned building scrappy technical prototypes, and only half the teams mentioned prototyping beyond the interaction layer. That’s a shame because joining the front-end up to the back-end in the alpha phase can result in a quicker beta phase, because there’s less back and forth between design and development. Aim for tangible, demoable prototypes as early as possible and integrate one slice of a step or service.We need more stories of teams using different types of prototyping well. If your service looks the same as 80% of services just like it, ignore the interaction layer: jump to the technical or operational layer, you’ll learn more.Paper prototyping is quick, fun and, most importantly, really helpful! An officially supported resource might help more teams engage with Policy and Comms colleagues through collaborative prototyping.My hunchWhile generative AI could help teams build more detailed prototypes more quickly, it won’t build capability. Better training, better pay, and better tools will bridge the gap between teams in the public and private sector.As GOV.UK Forms offers more components and patterns to services, it’ll become a more helpful prototyping tool for teams with little funding and little digital training and experience. For example, it doesn’t expect users to know the difference between radio buttons and checkboxes, it simply asks if users should choose one option or many.What do you think?Does any of above ring true for your organisation? Or have you learned something you might take back to base? I’d love to hear from more people!",

Also didn’t set goals at the start of the week, so felt a bit aimless at times, but still got plenty of good work done.What did I do this week? Here’s a half-remembered list. (I did way more than this.)  Joined the fortnightly sprint ceremonies: show &amp; tell, retro, and planning  Added a guide to our team playbook  Caught up with our community designer on plans for launching Task List, a new pattern co-designed by the community  Spoke to a recruiter about a new contracting opportunity  Went to our Wednesday morning fika, where one of our designers introduced her history and what she likes doing  Planned the final stages of our WCAG 2.2 work, with a focus on getting it released after the festive break  Caught up with the Head of User Research on upskilling people across the programme  Joined the final Ethics in design class  Caught up with our deputy director  Met our new colleagues in Comms  Checked-in with our senior management team  Spent an afternoon working through my thoughts on a strategy for the GOV.‌UK Design System  Caught up with a couple of our devs, mostly to check understanding on release plans  Added videos from Design System Day to the website  Met a team in another department looking at ‘AI patterns’  Wrote a note for the leadership team on how we’re collaborating on design across directorates  Some other stuff I cannot rememberSpeeds of collaborationDuring the pandemic, I really nerded out on remote-working principles and practices. I was obsessed with learning how to do it well. Xander and I ran an experiment with the GOV.‌UK Pay team where we worked asynchronously for two weeks, I kept notes on how companies we adapting their offices for hybrid remote-first working, and I wrote about the free-range future of work.One of the things I learned was how to use instant messaging, email, documents and meetings properly. The four speeds of collaboration. The basic idea is that collaboration happens at different speeds and the medium of collaboration sets some rules. If you post a message on Slack, that’s instant messaging, and everyone’s going to assume you need an answer right away. When that’s not necessarily the case, maybe you’re just starting a slow-burning conversation. But without prefacing your message with whether it’s urgent or not, everyone’s likely to treat it as urgent because you’re using an instant messaging tool.I figured that was something most people knew but I don’t think they do. And for reasons I can’t remember, a designer helpfully brought it up in our retro when talking about how to get help from other people on the team. They also suggested a basic template for giving team-members more context about your ask, so I added it to our team playbook.While adding it, I looked in the GDS wiki to see whether there was any guidance on async communication, remote-first working, and how to use time in the office properly – I wanted to link to and point at things the organisation had shared. But I found nothing. Which really surprised me, to be honest. We had guides for that at Claimer and NHS Digital, but not at the organisation leading digital transformation in the UK government.I’ll add a bunch more stuff to the team playbook but perhaps it’ll be useful to run some lunch &amp; learns or add stuff to the wiki. I’ll ask people working in Business &amp; People Services (the ops and HR bit).Ethics in designThe final lesson went over Ariel’s theory of professions and why those have ethical responsibilities (which I knew from reading his book). Then we looked at cultural differences in ethics, responsibility in design, and making the case for design ethics. That last bit was all about how to write a business case for design ethics, how it can increase revenue, decrease costs or decrease risk. As the only product manager on the course, I really felt like I was in my element there!It’s been an excellent course, not just because it has practical tools you can use but also because it dives into philosophy and ethical theory, the hard academic stuff. Check it out.Thinking through strategyGeorge and I spent a few hours working through my thoughts on a new strategic model for the GOV.‌UK Design System. I’ve been building this model up over time, informed by a few workshops with the team and working on growth and community strategies too. I’d got to a point where writing in docs just wasn’t doing it any more, so I asked George if I could get it all out and have her pick holes in it.First thing to mention: it was lovely to just slam some things up on a whiteboard, haven’t done that in yonks. A content designer from GOV.‌UK even said it gave him the warm-fuzzies seeing people doing that again. A hark back to times of yore.The strategic model I’ve had in my head seemed pretty hare-brained, I didn’t really know if it could work, but working through it with George I was able to validate that parts of it do work because we’ve been doing that stuff already. And we can prove it.The biggest help she gave was asking about the strategic context. That’s something I’d mentioned on some documents but not the main place I was collating all my thoughts. What is the strategic context? Simple. Technology is always changing and people’s expectations change with it. What was good enough in 2018 is now old-hat, and people expect more ease and convenience in a modern, high-quality user experience. This is something I’ve been banging on about since 2019: transforming government to be user-centred isn’t finished.So, anyway, we had this big model sorted and all the factors were highlighted. We could show how adding a few more people to the team to do specific activities would lead to growth, a better quality design system that meets its users’ needs, and would free up capacity on our team for maintaining the thing. The next thing to think through was how to frame it. Usually I’ll reach for classic product management narratives: if we do X, it will lead to Y measurable benefit. However, the biggest problem any design system has is traceability – you never know exactly how much impact you’re having. It’s a hyperobject.George suggested some policy-style narratives instead, the sort you see used to support government policies, which are even harder to measure. If we do X for society, it will lead to Y societal benefits. More Theory of Change than business case.I’m fairly certain I’ve everything I need to pull this together now. Thinking out loud, my next steps are:  pull the model together and explain it, showing the potential return on investment  run that past the team, highlighting the risky assumptions  add those risky assumptions to the discovery objectives we wrote a few months ago  plan a discovery around those objectives  reach out to teams in government, and  run the discovery.This should mean I can end my time on the GOV.‌UK Design System by handing over a validated strategic model that they can start implementing, using it to shape roadmaps, ways of working and hiring plans.I hinted at some of what’s next at Design System Day, so check out the video at 26m59s for more on that.‘AI patterns’A team dropped us a line to talk about ‘AI patterns’, as they wanted to make sure they were looking at this in the right way. We’re always happy to help out with this stuff, so it was good to get involved.Largely they were asking about how to style a chatbot interface, but their interaction designer had done some good work to look at how people had done that already.‘AI patterns’ seemed to be shorthand for ‘use large language models to augment support provided by people over the phone’, which was the assisted digital companion to a list of searchable, filterable documents that users could look through themselves. Basically, if a user didn’t look through those documents, they could call up a phone line, tell the support agent what they wanted help on, and the support agent was supposed to re-key that help request into a large language model which would spit out an answer.Which seems like a really expensive, cumbersome way to get an answer to people.First of all, running and maintaining large language models is expensive. You’ve got to pay for input tokens – some times output tokens too – and that could cost 5–10 pence per session.Then you’ve got to think about how much it costs in people time to tweak and engineer the model to spit out useful answers based on the prompts. Highly skilled developers need to do that, and those people cost lots of money.I could go on, but I’ll stop there before it becomes a rant.As much as I think it’s worthwhile to be exploring new technologies, you need to make sure the juice is going to be worth the squeeze. Spending several months and tens of thousands of pounds trying to add automation to a process that works well already is a waste of money and time. Use technologies appropriately, don’t just follow the latest hype.RunningDid zero training this week. Thought I was coming down with a terrible flu last weekend which made me feel worse on Monday, but it never really hit. So I guess I’ll pick it up again next week.BookmarksFeeling particularly proud today as I’ve managed to fix a broken automation. Whenever I archive something in Pocket, a Zapier automation adds that to a running Google Doc which holds a list of everything I’ve read since 2019.

I was obsessed with learning how to do it well. Xander and I ran an experiment with the GOV.‌UK Pay team where <a href=\"https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/\">we worked asynchronously for two weeks</a>, I kept notes on how companies we adapting their offices for <del>hybrid</del> remote-first working, and I wrote about <a href=\"/2020/11/02/free-range-future-of-work\">the free-range future of work</a>.</p><p>One of the things I learned was how to use instant messaging, email, documents and meetings properly.

The basic idea is that collaboration happens at different speeds and the medium of collaboration sets some rules. If you post a message on Slack, that’s instant messaging, and everyone’s going to assume you need an answer right away.

Today I’ve got the day off to nerd out at ffconf1.The three main tasks I did this week were  review feedback from Design System Day 2023 and decide what we should keep, add, do more or do less next time, so that it can better achieve its goals  define some objectives and key results (OKRs) for our community strategy, so that the direction and high-level goals are more clear to others  shape a stream of research with our user researcher that will form a growing base of insights about our service propositionWe were co-located in Manchester. It was lovely to work with people, face-to-face, drawing on walls. You can do that stuff online, it’s not impossible, but my preference is for free-flowing conversation, no distractions from notifications, and scribbling on walls and paper, not digital whiteboards.Community strategyMost of what I did was retrofit some structure to an already great strategy that Imran has been executing. We want to add more people to that workstream, make it a little squad, so the structure is mostly for their benefit. But defining the key results, some kind of performance indicator, was also essential for being able to show our senior management team and others that the community model works. That it feeds in to growing the design system’s userbase and impact.We didn’t get as far as defining the OKRs, but we did review the strategy so far: the problems it’s looking to solve, for whom and how. The behaviour change it intends to create. Off the back of reviewing that, we wrote some hypothesis statements for all the different initiatives. For example, because people are intimidated by looking silly or don’t think our Slack channel is active, we think that that posting in Slack more regularly about interesting blog posts, useful conversations, and asking questions will mean people move from being lurkers to more active participants, measured by an increase in new posters.Next we’ll need to get all the hypothesis statements up on a wall, see which we can combine or group together, and then decide a sequence of tasks. You can’t do it all at once. Sequencing the initiatives will form a roadmap, and grouping the statements together will form some OKRs.The other main thing we achieved that day was deciding which community members we’d focus on. We’ve got a handful of very engaged people and many lurkers, but we need to bring in more of the lurkers and get them participating actively. The Dunning-Kruger effect tells us that people with low to medium experience in a field are more likely to engage compared to people who’ve been in their roles a long time, so bringing out those folks should be more fruitful.We’ll see, anyway. Onwards!Shaping up researchThe main problem to solve here was to give our user researcher a continuous body of work. Research on the team can be very stop/start: there’s lots to do when we start looking at new component or pattern, then it goes quiet while the designers and developers do things, and then there’s a big need for the researcher when we get to usability testing. It’s hard to fill the gaps because you don’t know how long a gap will last, and working on components and patterns isn’t the only workstream: we want to improve the design system as a service too.The day was mostly focused around defining a lens for the research and some problem statements to kick things off. It’s a big space and the blank page problem can be hard to push through, but I dug out some work Ignacia did on the service design a while back and we used that as a base. (It felt good not to reinvent the wheel! This team remembers.)Rather than research all the stages of the service, we’ve decided to focus on the first one, when people explore which components and patterns they might need for a given project and the GOV.‌UK Design System is one of the resources they review. We believe that we do things very well for people who’ve got lots of experience in their role or have been in the government digital space for a while, but people on the lower end of those scales aren’t as well catered for.For example, the people working in customer support who are suddenly given digital responsibilities and have to wear multiple hats. Or the people who’ve transitioned to being a designer after many years working in another field. Or the people who’ve been in tech for a few years but only recently started working in the public sector, who don’t have a good picture of the landscape and have no idea why they’re being told that date pickers are bad.Anything we learn about these people should enable us to make improvements to our service that benefit everyone, and make it easier for the people after them to use the design system too. It feels like there’s high turnover in government, people joining and leaving the space regularly, and the data shows that there’s a skills deficit, so you can bet that more people need help and more people will join over the years. So it makes sense to focus on those people. It’ll be a while before a platform like GOV.‌UK Forms can sustain them, and they’ll still need to know which components and patterns to use anyway, which is help and guidance we provide.Moving back to a more regular cadence of research will be great, a bit more like the old days. And we’re not re-asking the same questions, we’ve given the research a totally new lens and focus. Onwards!Ethics in designThis week was all about exploring and analysing risks and harms using a set of different tools. They shared a bunch of different resources we could use in team workshops, one of which I had used before. It reminded me that I’d done some work like that on a team before, so I’ll write it up soon.Bookmarks  WeWork… never worked  Six months in an op shop, 10 mins  The OpenAI Keynote, 17 mins            Nearly missed my train to East Croydon because I was tinkering with my website, which feels rather apt. &#8617;      ",

We want to add more people to that workstream, make it a little squad, so the structure is mostly for their benefit.

            "content_text": "It’s Tuesday morning. My alarm just went off, but I’m already standing on the platform at Norwood Junction railway station. My train doesn’t arrive for another 10 minutes so I might as well tap out last week’s weeknotes.And there’s not many tasks to list. Last week was full of face-time and working with people instead of working near them, through tickets and docs and emails and instant messages.What did we do?  We had our final team coaching session  We had our final team leads coaching session  We had show &amp; tell, retro and planning  We checked in with our senior management team  And I went to the second ’Ethics in design’ classI took Friday off to travel to Llandeilo, on the western edge of the Bannau Brycheiniog, for a long weekend.Feedback and gratitudeThe main focus of the final coaching session was sharing feedback, recognising growth, and showing gratitude for each other. We’ve been on this journey for six months together, and it’s been excellent to step back and see the change. So we kicked off by acknowledging that. We’ve captured the feedback on letters to hand to people’s line managers too, it can feed into professional development reviews.There were two main goals with the coaching: reduce risk-aversion and increase confidence with engaging externally. We shared so many examples of that in the feedback, there really has been some growth. But I don’t believe it would have been possible without growing internal trust too.Next up, the team gave the leads some good feedback, and we all showed gratitude to each other. There’s a lot of trust amongst everyone now, you can feel it. You can see it too. No longer a group of skilled individuals but a unit, using their unique skills and perspectives to pull as one.Throughout the rest of the day everyone workshopped ideas for how we’ll make improvements elsewhere, for example, by iterating our ways of working or making it more clear when a specific is or isn’t needed. Continuous improvement, that’s sustainable beyond the end of the coaching sessions.There’s a model starting to emerge in my mind that by improving the dark matter between people, the invisible stuff that holds the team together, the team can grow capability as a unit. You have to aim for functioning, not just building capability.LeadingThe final coaching session for the team leads was all about leading. Regardless of your organisation’s structure and how it pays people, most teams need some form of local leadership. People who get the context and understand the people. Usually they’re managers or senior specialists in a big organisation but they don’t have ‘Head of’ or ‘Lead’ in their title. In a smaller organisation you’re more able to claim that title and the pay that goes with it. But you’ll have to do some leading.It’d be nice if the people at the top could do all the leading, but as an organisation grows the fracture planes start to show their breaks. So you need more people doing a bit of leading.The GOV.‌UK Design System isn’t a team inside a programme inside a directorate inside an organisation, in my view. It’s not bounded by the organisation, it has stakeholders across an entire industrial sector. It has influence and it needs directing, it needs to nurture relationships with its stakeholders, and that needs a bit of leadership.We gave each other feedback and talked about models for leading the team, which I’ve taken to calling TeamOps. (Everyone’s obsessed with putting Ops at the end of nouns, aren’t they?) Like the final team session, it was all about making TeamOps sustainable.I was incredibly grateful to get some tear-jerking gratitude from the other leads. Now I know what people mean when they say ‘I feel seen’. And it’s going to make it hard to leave them in February, but I’m blessed to have been able to spend some time with them.Ethics in designThis week’s lesson was all about going beyond moral intuition and hunches to find reasons and justifications which we can present to others. It’s important in both established and emergent contexts: intuition can’t provide answers in new scenarios, you need to work through to a reasoned conclusion.The lightbulb moment for me was using different ethical lenses to make hypothetical and real moral judgments in order to discuss the different possible impacts, provide reasons and justifications to help us work out which choice to make. Help us uncover the embedded ethics.So we took different ethical theories and applied them to scenarios, which helped us provide reasons for and against certain ventures. Theory made practical. It also helped us consider viewpoints beyond the users of a thing, going beyond being user-centred.RunningHaving not been running all week, neglecting my training plan due to busy days in the office, I made up for it with a 32km run in south Wales on Sunday. It was a beautiful day with very little rain, and I really do find being in the outdoors a tonic. When your route takes you past an old castle unexpectedly, how can you not?! Check out photos of Castell Carreg Cennen, it’s stunning.My route tied together parts of the Heart of Wales Trail, the Beacons Way, and some public rights of way. Very muddy at times but rather wet too, meaning the mud washed off in puddles and streams. It was cloudy on Tair Carn Isaf, the summit, but there were plenty of good views before reaching that summit.After 1,155km (about 717 miles) I retired my ASICS Gel-Trabuco 9 GTX shoes. The toe cap separated from the upper, the upper was ripped around the toe box, and although the tread was good they were starting to feel like flip-flops. They served me well on many adventures.This week I’m in Manchester without any opportunity to get into the Peak District, so I’ll stick to the streets.Bookmarks  Joe Biden moves to compel tech groups to share AI safety test results, mins  Infomorph, mins  UX/Design Leaders: Understand the motivation of your peers and stakeholders the same way you do your users and customers, mins  Biden releases AI executive order directing agencies to develop safety guidelines, 3 mins  Bank of England holds interest rates at 5.25%, mins  People’s Panel on AI Bulletin 1, 3 mins  People’s Panel on AI Bulletin 2, 3 mins  People’s Panel on AI Bulletin 3, 5 mins  People’s Panel on AI Bulletin 4, 3 mins  The Future of the Blogosphere, 10 mins  The Future of RSS is Textcasting, 4 mins  No Broken Browsers, 3 mins  Grok This  Resurrecting web marginalia, 2 mins  A one-off, special, never-to-be-repeated Acts Not Facts weeknote, 5 mins",

I started it off feeling tired again due to this low-level cold that is 5% there – not a full cold – but after Kelly recommended I take Monday afternoon off and nap, I felt much better. Thank you, Kelly.I completed 25 tasks last week, which is about the average. Last week I  caught up with Kelly  planned as a group of leads how we’ll give the team some feedback  finalised plans for the last coaching session with Stefan  joined the organisers’ retro for Design System Day to identify what changes might make it a better event (and better to organise) next time  joined the mid-sprint review  spent too much time with my head in Slack, which lead to me keeping it closed for most of Friday  prepared the slide deck for Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s final coaching sessions  drafted feedback for people on the team  finished off the agenda for a team creative week  joined the first lesson in the ‘Ethics in design’ course  threw together a proof-of-concept and put it down again  prepared some slides about the proof-of-concept for show &amp; tell, telling people which user insights gave birth to the idea, and helping me frame how I’ll show it  scoped an epic to migrate our website from one host to another (iterating on the light planning I did last week)  helped someone at MOJ describe what a content designer does on a design system team  put out several calls for teams to share their findings from researching and testing components and patterns  spent time with David, who’s handing the WCAG 2.2 work over to me  joined the GDS product management community catch-up and heard what Mind the Product’s conference was like, thanks to Tobi and Mehmet  spoke to some folks at HMRC, following on from the service assessment, and applauded them on their assurance direction  helped David deliver our third WCAG 2.2 inspection workshop, this time on Accessible AuthenticationTracking workI achieved 1 of the week’s goals, progressed 2 other goals, and didn’t start 1 goal, but that wasn’t time-sensitive, so it was OK. A lot of my work was unplanned last week too, as illnesses on the team meant I had to cover other people or people reached out for help and advice.At the start of the month, I set way more goals that I did previously: 14 in total! My achievement rate was 28%, which was lower than last month, but I did make good progress on 50% of my goals for the month, which I’m happy with. Combining the achievement and progression rate, I got about as much done this month as last month.The 3 goals for the month I didn’t achieve feel like the most important to get done at some point, hopefully soon, but we’re taking chunks out of them by running some strategy days in Manchester next week. So perhaps I should just break them down.Ethics in designI’m doing this to fill a knowledge gap and keep abreast of developments in the design, data and technology industry. We weren’t taught ethics at my school, it wasn’t part of the curriculum, and it didn’t come up in my degree either. Literature comes at ethics from a different angle. It presents ethical dilemmas and asks you to dig into the characters, or the message the author is trying to get across, or how the author’s context might have informed the scene. But it doesn’t give you the tools to explore the dilemma, to weigh it up.We didn’t learn it in Economics either. You’re sort of near it when learning about monopolies and oligopolies, or minimum fiscal and productivity thresholds for being a part of the EU’s monetary union. But no one ever said we were looking at a system which had impacts on people, though it could have been a good idea to acknowledge that.The first class was really good, met my expectations. I’m glad it started with some homework, it helped me get my head into the subject…although I have been reading Ariel’s book so I’m not totally alien to the concepts. We had to reflect on Mike Monteiro’s article, A Designer’s Code of Ethics, the language of which was the thing that surprised me the most. Something close to vitriol that I imagine would scare and overwhelm new designers early in their craft. Ariel’s review showed how other language is available.One really useful part of the lesson was how ‘ethics’ can seem like a big word, with big implications, like ‘strategy’, which can be scary or make people worried. But when you get down to it, we’re just talking about our values and seeking some alignment on those because we care about the impact our designs have. And most people care about not making a negative impact, not hurting people, it’s something we have in common. So let’s start there, with what’s common amongst us.There are jobs with a clear, heavy ethical weight to them, like soldiers and surgeons, for example. They make life and death decisions! But as designers, product managers, developers and researchers, there are implications on millions of people from the technologies we make. So we’ve walked into that sphere and there’s some ethical weight to our jobs too. What we produce can cause people to decide how to live their lives.At one point I asked Cennydd about the line between ethics and politics, and he presented a helpful framework: ethics is how we treat each other well; politics is how we structure society to treat each other well.The most blazed note I’ve written is ‘A value framework is moral telepathy’. Helping you speak to someone or imagine how they’d react through a shared model or view of the world.One super helpful concept to learn was multistability, from Don Idhe. You can design something for one purpose but it might get used in other ways. A hammer is a classic and simple example. The engineering of a machine gun was what made Remington really good at making typewriters too. “When you invent the ship, you also invent the shipwreck,” as Paul Virilio said.The law of unintended consequences says you will always miss some consequences, so just design for the intended outcome. But we really should talk about unconsidered (not unintended) consequences: things that we haven’t bothered to try to foresee. The choice not to anticipate potential risks is itself an ethical choice.It’s a small class, 6 or 7 students, which should mean we can have some good conversations. A few people didn’t speak much, though. I’ll try and encourage them in the next session, I’d love to hear their views and responses, which are no doubt different to mine – there’s people based in Europe and other, more far-flung countries on the course.Clearing outWent to my recently deceased grandmother’s home to help my mum and aunt with clearing the place out. She’d got rid of a lot of things when downsizing, so the majority of what was left was what she cared about (I presume). I took some small sentimental things – pictures, photographs, her rolling pin – and found a Braun Type 4746 AB1, a clock designed by Dietrich Lubs.It’s the photographs I love the most. Pictures of my grandparents enjoying themselves as young people, before they had children. It’s them, it’s their characters, exuding fun and conviviality. Happiness after years of war. Moments of joy.RunningA steady return to marathon training. I’ve switched to running at lunchtime, so that I don’t have to deal with cold, rainy mornings, a trick that worked well last year. That’s disrupted when I have to go into the office, though, so I need to work that out. And it’s so nice to have lunch with colleagues, I’d rather not be running, alone. So maybe I’ll just stick with the cold and rainy mornings on those days.Started planning a couple of fastpacking trips. One for April, one for May or June. I learned that Wales has some bothies – old stone houses and sheds used for shelter – so I’ll do a trip tying together all the bothies in Eryri. Should be fun!

In fact, I did 29 tasks (at least) this week, which is close to the weekly average. Around 40% of that was unplanned work, but I did manage to make progress on 2 of the 5 goals I set at the start of the week. I achieved 1 goal for the week and deprioritised 2 others.There’s still a buzz on the team after Design System Day, and we’re leaning in to that momentum. Speaking to more users, questioning the existing model, thinking about risky decisions. Treasury Brain will ask you to link cause to effect and monetary value, but there’s always some hard-to-quantify positive overspill.Everyone should read the BBC’s research into how people feel about the world. It’s a fabulous resource and I’m grateful to them for publishing research openly. Maybe public investment in research and innovation could break the hype cycle?Matt’s talkThe main point I wanted to pull from Matt’s talk was related to burnout.The toll a purpose-driven job takes on people is widely regarded in health and care settings. You invest a little bit of yourself in every interaction with a patient, and it’s similar in digital public service. Even though you act with impartiality and you’re not always working directly with humans, your work is essentially humanist, for the benefit of your fellow people. And that can be draining.So people and organisations need to be aware of that and focus on prevention of mental, physical and emotional burnout.But if you zoom out from the organisation, you can see that everyone went through the same pandemic, but not everyone recovered in the same way. So now is probably a good time to be a little more cognisant of how people are coping and whether they’re doing well or not.Matt’s published his talk on his website.SoloLast night I went to watch a film about Jenny Tough, a super cool fastpacker. The film had an unexpected message about feminism and how our society is still too obsessed with body image, which was fantastic.

In fact, I did 29 tasks (at least) this week, which is close to the weekly average. Around 40% of that was unplanned work, but I did manage to make progress on 2 of the 5 goals I set at the start of the week. I achieved 1 goal for the week and deprioritised 2 others.</p><p>There’s still a buzz on the team after Design System Day, and we’re leaning in to that momentum. Speaking to more users, questioning the existing model, thinking about risky decisions. Treasury Brain will ask you to link cause to effect and monetary value, but there’s always some hard-to-quantify positive overspill.</p><p>Everyone should read the BBC’s research into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2023-10-projections-things-are-not-normal?utm_source=pocket_saves\">how people feel about the world</a>. It’s a fabulous resource and I’m grateful to them for publishing research openly. Maybe public investment in research and innovation could <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2023/10/18/design-cycles-sarah-housley-opinion/?utm_source=pocket_saves\">break the hype cycle</a>?</p><h2 id=\"matts-talk\">Matt’s talk</h2><p>The main point I wanted to pull from Matt’s talk was related to burnout.</p><p>The toll a purpose-driven job takes on people is widely regarded <a href=\"https://www.nhsemployers.org/articles/beating-burnout-nhs\">in health and care settings</a>. You invest a little bit of yourself in every interaction with a patient, and it’s similar in digital public service. Even though you act with impartiality and you’re not always working directly with humans, your work is essentially humanist, for the benefit of your fellow people. And that can be draining.</p><p>So people and organisations need to be aware of that and focus on prevention of mental, physical and emotional burnout.</p><p>But if you zoom out from the organisation, you can see that everyone went through the same pandemic, but not everyone recovered in the same way. So now is probably a good time to be a little more cognisant of how people are coping and whether they’re doing well or not.</p><p>Matt’s published his talk <a href=\"https://blog.mattedgar.com/2023/10/22/the-humans-of-digital-transformation-a-talk-for-digital-government-north-and-reprised-for-the-gds-speaker-series/\">on his website</a>.</p><h2 id=\"solo\">Solo</h2><p>Last night I went to watch a film about <a href=\"http://jennytough.com/films\">Jenny Tough</a>, a super cool fastpacker.

            "content_text": "So I overheard my partner listening to the latest episode of The Intelligence podcast and it had a bit on handwritten notes. As someone who types a lot of notes, their claim that handwritten notes are better really stood out.Here’s what they said:  Well, there are lots of different studies on the topic, and it turns out that writing on paper can improve everything from recalling items on a random list of words to actually inviting a better conceptual grasp of complex ideas.  They’ve been seen to lie somewhere in the kind of motor and sensory systems that are used to do these things and the memory that is recruited when you write things down and if you try to play a piece on the piano a bunch of times your fingers will start to learn the music as well as your auditory system, and that goes as well for writing things down.  You might also notice the visual shape of the page where you wrote notes down on a page or where you wrote a specific word to remember or something like that, so that recruits your visual memory as well.  The biggest advantage seems to be in superior note taking by people who do it with a pen and paper.  Just to write things down with a pen and paper, it is slower for almost everybody, nearly everyone, can type faster than they can write with a pen, especially at the college level.  But it turns out there’s an advantage in that inefficiency, which means that it makes you compress ideas as you’re writing them down. It means you have to be thinking as you’re writing as a result, what goes down is a sort of distilled essence that’s already been through your brain.  Students who take handwritten notes have consistently well outperform students who take typed notes, and that’s because the students who type there’s are taking a lot more down, there’s a lot more words on the page, but those notes are almost entirely verbatim, which means they’re not really going through the brain quite in the same way, and that seems to make it a big difference.I mean, I get it. There are notes I’ve taken that make no sense whatsoever and those were typed. But I believe you can engage that ‘idea compression’ bit of your brain when typing notes as well as handwriting them.You don’t have to handwrite a piece of music to learn how to play it, do you?I used to work with a developer who was incredible at this. In user research sessions, he’d be typing furiously, but he always seemed to be lagging behind what the user was saying. His notes weren’t verbatim, they were shorter and, most importantly, made sense. He listened, processed what was being said, formed a better compressed sentence in his head and wrote down that compressed sentence.So I’m not sure it’s terribly accurate to say that handwriting notes is superior. You just have to engage the right part of the brain when typing notes.",

Looking forward to going over the community strategy with Imran over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>We’re doing further feedback analysis to see what we could improve further, but that was a successful first in-person (and online!) conference delivered.</p><h2 id=\"running\">Running</h2><p>Delighted to say that I got a new personal best (PB) at the Shrewsbury half-marathon finishing in 1 hour 40 minutes and 56 seconds! That’s 56 seconds off my A goal of 1h40m and well over my B goal of 1h51m. Super happy.</p><p>I didn’t go for a run at all last week. Had planned on circling Arthur’s Seat on Tuesday morning but we had to be at Dynamic Earth, the conference venue, so early that I just couldn’t manage it. My sports watch is now telling me that I’m detraining.</p><p>I’ll get back out this week, but that was a successful season: my first marathon done and I a PB in the half.</p><h2 id=\"bookmarks\">Bookmarks</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3Q6XJ6n\">Is it selfish to run a marathon?</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.bram.us/2023/10/09/the-future-of-css-easy-light-dark-mode-color-switching-with-light-dark/\">The Future of CSS: Easy Light-Dark Mode Color Switching with light-dark()</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://digitalbydefault.com/2023/10/13/week-four-im-listening/\">Week Four – I’m Listening </a>, 3 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://shinytoyrobots.substack.com/p/the-hub-and-spoke-design-system-model\">The hub and spoke design system model</a>, 4 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.rubick.com/three-anti-patterns-for-project-management/\">Make your team miserable with one of these popular project-management anti-patterns</a>, 8 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://linear.app/blog/how-we-run-projects-at-linear\">How we run projects at Linear</a>, 6 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://blog.tobiasrevell.com/2023/10/11/box099-1-15-years-of-blogging/\">BOX099.1: 15 Years of Blogging</a>, 6 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://ra.co/features/4255\">Goldie: The Key Component is Soul</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://techlifeweb.com/blog/2023/05/2023-05-03-post-726/\">Work is starting on a protocol bridge between ActivityPub and the AT protocol</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-collaboration-challenges/\">CrossFunctional-Collaboration: Challenges and Strategies for Success</a>, 12 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://public.digital/2023/10/02/preparing-for-the-next-uk-general-election\">Preparing for the next UK general election — Public Digital</a>, 3 mins</li></ul>",

Buzzing about Design System Day next week though, it’s gonna be a blast.What did I do this week?  Caught up with one of our delivery managers, who came back from holiday  Met the other leads on the team to discuss a move away from traditional Scrum  Contributed to  speaker biographies and session information being on separate pages on the Design System website  Ran the fortnightly team reflection session  Sketched out a narrative for the Design System team showcase at Design System Day  Refined the epic for Show password, a new component we’re adding to the design system  Shuffled along some pull requests on the new Task List component and pattern  Joined the discussion on getting rid of the Experimental tag  Collaborated on publishing a standardised format for collecting evidence, so it’s easier for service teams to share research findings with us  Had a check-in with our senior management team  Asked speakers to send their slides for day 1 over to us  Caught up on the latest in our accessibility strategy  Tested out Hopin, which we’re using for day 2  Met with customer success folks at Slack to talk about how we use cross-government Slack (and how our team need more features)  Ran through the plans for day 1 and day 2 of Design System Day  Started preparing the slides for the Design System team showcase at Design System Day  Sketched out the roadmap for Q3Tracking workOf the 7 goals I set this week, I achieved 1 goal, progressed 3 goals, and didn’t start 3 other goals. Although it feels like a failure, when I look at the work I did do, almost half of the 20 tasks I did this week were all related to Design System Day. That was the right thing to work on, so really I was overambitious with the variety of work I’d be able to achieve this week.I’m also taking some work into the weekend, so it’s clear I didn’t prioritise the right work for the week. Having said that, if I’d dropped the Q3 roadmap work for more time on Design System Day, I’d be worried about what we’re going to do after DS Day – but now I’m not.Tell you what, tracking my work like this and having a feedback loop to see whether I did the right stuff or not is working well.Moving away from ScrumOur delivery manager pitched this as a move away from the 2-week cycle to 4-week cycle, with 1 of those weeks as a reflection and planning week. It should give more time and space for planning – sketching out how we’ll tackle a piece of work and the skills needed – and continuous improvement – collaborating on changes to our ways of working.It’s a good suggestion, as we don’t spend nearly enough time planning work and discussing process improvements as we should. I’ve spent more time on elaboration and planning in teams outside of GDS, and you had to adapt ways of working every cycle at the startup, so I was adapting our playbook every week.I think there’s room to adapt some other aspects of our ways of working, mainly a move to the team pitching work rather than being recipients of work requests. The Betting Table, where people pitch work, is how we might do this but one of our developers shared a similar process from Valve.No doubt we’ll work on this more in November, so keep an eye out for developments in my weeknotes. (You can also subscribe by email or RSS, check the footer at the bottom of my site.)Data in SlackThere’s key data about our community and engagement in Slack, but we don’t have access to it. This sucks as we need those metrics, it all feeds in to our community strategy: how we make the community a key actor in iterating and evolving the GOV.‌UK Design System.There’s two options: get more data from cross-government Slack or splinter off and create our own workspace. We’d rather not do the latter and there are switching costs for the community who already use cross-government Slack. But luckily CDDO is trialling paying for cross-gov Slack to see whether it’s valuable, and I’ve been able to liaise with the customer success folks at Slack who can empathise with what we’re trying to do.I suspect we wouldn’t have to do this if the Communications and Engagement functions hadn’t been shrunk so drastically by previous deputy directors, but there you go. It’s still ludicrous to me that an organisation building digital products and services, and trying to grow those products and services, doesn’t have enough people doing digital marketing. You can build whatever you want, but if no one knows about it no one will use it.So, anyway, putting the rant aside, Slack are going to send us the aggregated data we need and look at giving us access to it too. I’ll be setting some OKRs with our community designer at the end of the month, as part of our community strategy (which is also part of our growth strategy), and many of the key results will use data from Slack as indicators or input metrics.RunningI’m in Shrewsbury for a half-marathon on Sunday. Haven’t done as much running this week as I’d have liked, but just going to trust that all the training I did for the marathon is still hanging around.My A goal is to finish in under 1 hour 40 minutes, my B goal is to beat my previous personal best of 1 hour 51 minutes, and my C goal under 2 hours.Not-drinkingNow that the marathon is out of the way, I’ve been enjoying the odd tipple here and there. After months off the booze, you can definitely feel how tired and sluggish alcohol makes you.I have found old behaviours creeping back that I’d like to nix.

Instead I’ll do the complicated, toilful thing and set up something I need to maintain.What did I get up to this (last) week?  Wrote a short description of what we do and where we’re going for GOV.‌UK Design System job adverts  Caught up with a product manager who worked at MOJ but recently joined GDS  Said hello to a new team member  Shuffled along some issues on GitHub  Prepared a volunteers’ guide for Design System Day  Published a code of conduct  Wrote and sent off follow-up questions for the service assessment from last week  Gathered willing participants for updating the product management learning list  Met with Ethan to go through the questions for our fireside talk  Published the programme of speakers and sessions for Design System Day 2023  Went to a great product community session with Randy Silver  Other stuff I didn’t make a note ofTracking workThis week I completed 25 tasks, although there’s a few I didn’t note down. Only 8 unplanned tasks this week. That means most of my time was spent on planned tasks. That matches up with my achievement rate of 87.5% this week – I achieved 7 out of 8 weekly goals!A few weeks ago I set my goals for the month, and I added to that list over the month, so I set 12 goals in total. I achieved 6 of those goals, an achievement rate of 50%, and I progressed 3 goals. So a lot of the work I did this month contributed to the goals I had set for the projects I’m working on. Nice.There were 3 goals I didn’t start but, to be fair, I descoped those based on a roadmap change. So I’m happy with not getting those done.Pretty sure I’m working on the right things. Unplanned work always crops up for product managers, but there was less of it last week. So I’m still spending the majority of my time on things that move the needle. Pretty happy with the achievement rate of monthly goals too. The high priority stuff got done.Might calculate how much time I spend on TeamOps, curious to know whether it’s a big portion of time.Design System Day 2023Everything’s starting to slot in to place with this now. It has been planned in detail and that’s paying off, all the major priority tasks have been done. We’ve got to do some training on Hopin for the second day of the conference, but that’ll chime nicely with a test run of the plan for both days.It’s always the same with running events. Everything seems manic and stressful in the run up, but the planning always pays off. I’ve been reminding the team that we’ve got the major stuff done so the conference is almost already a confirmed success. It’s still worth reserving a little energy for adapting to last-minute changes on the day though.I’m trying not to get too busy on other things so I can be a backstop for any big-effort tasks, but it’s all going well so far.Agile governance and communicationsAt the product community session, I asked Randy a question about tactics for agile governance and communication as organisations scale. Show &amp; tells and blogging filled this purpose at GDS in the early days, but 10 years later things haven’t really changed.If anything, the blogging has dried up compared to the early proliferation of many posts per week. There’s internal weeknotes but these are bullet points that don’t capture the context or detail of our deep work. And senior management and leadership is too busy to come to show &amp; tells, they’re pulled in so many directions keeping the organisation going.Randy’s answer was to ask what I needed from those people and to find out what works. It shifts the onus on to the product manager to create the environment in which governance and communication can happen. While I think that’s a fair shift to expect working inside a growing organisation, I do think the responsibility is shared: between product people, senior management teams and leadership. We’re all time-poor, let’s meet in the middle.Having said that, what do I really need? What clarity can I create?In a way, I have a layered internal communication strategy right now. A fortnightly show &amp; tell for intra-team alignment and feedback; a fortnightly check-in with senior management, for reporting progress and highlighting key developments; and a weekly broadcast weeknote with top-level headlines (awareness-generating and hopefully conversation-starting).

Only 8 unplanned tasks this week. That means most of my time was spent on planned tasks. That matches up with my achievement rate of 87.5% this week – I achieved 7 out of 8 weekly goals!</p><p>A few weeks ago I set my goals for the month, and I added to that list over the month, so I set 12 goals in total. I achieved 6 of those goals, an achievement rate of 50%, and I progressed 3 goals. So a lot of the work I did this month contributed to the goals I had set for the projects I’m working on. Nice.</p><p>There were 3 goals I didn’t start but, to be fair, I descoped those based on a roadmap change. So I’m happy with not getting those done.</p><p>Pretty sure I’m working on the right things. Unplanned work always crops up for product managers, but there was less of it last week. So I’m still spending the majority of my time on things that move the needle. Pretty happy with the achievement rate of monthly goals too. The high priority stuff got done.</p><p>Might calculate how much time I spend on TeamOps, curious to know whether it’s a big portion of time.</p><h2 id=\"design-system-day-2023\">Design System Day 2023</h2><p>Everything’s starting to slot in to place with this now. It has been planned in detail and that’s paying off, all the major priority tasks have been done. We’ve got to do some training on Hopin for the second day of the conference, but that’ll chime nicely with a test run of the plan for both days.</p><p>It’s always the same with running events. Everything seems manic and stressful in the run up, but the planning always pays off. I’ve been reminding the team that we’ve got the major stuff done so the conference is almost already a confirmed success. It’s still worth reserving a little energy for adapting to last-minute changes on the day though.</p><p>I’m trying not to get too busy on other things so I can be a backstop for any big-effort tasks, but it’s all going well so far.</p><h2 id=\"agile-governance-and-communications\">Agile governance and communications</h2><p>At the product community session, I asked Randy a question about tactics for agile governance and communication as organisations scale. Show &amp; tells and blogging filled this purpose at GDS in the early days, but 10 years later things haven’t really changed.</p><p>If anything, the blogging has dried up compared to the early proliferation of many posts per week. There’s internal weeknotes but these are bullet points that don’t capture the context or detail of our deep work. And senior management and leadership is too busy to come to show &amp; tells, they’re pulled in so many directions keeping the organisation going.</p><p>Randy’s answer was to ask what I needed from those people and to find out what works. It shifts the onus on to the product manager to create the environment in which governance and communication can happen. While I think that’s a fair shift to expect working inside a growing organisation, I do think the responsibility is shared: between product people, senior management teams <em>and</em> leadership. We’re all time-poor, let’s meet in the middle.</p><p>Having said that, what do I really need? What clarity can I create?</p><p>In a way, I have a layered internal communication strategy right now. A fortnightly show &amp; tell for intra-team alignment and feedback; a fortnightly check-in with senior management, for reporting progress and highlighting key developments; and a weekly broadcast weeknote with top-level headlines (awareness-generating and hopefully conversation-starting). If you want to know more from the weeknote or a check-in, there’s a series of show &amp; tells I can link you to – or those can be reformulated into a single narrative. But only the team get the stories, everyone else gets highlights.</p><p>Is that all they need or want?

Even though I’ve got a good 4 months left before I finish my contract with the GOV.‌UK Design System team at GDS, the end is starting to approach. I can feel it. I’m saying ‘When I’ll be gone’ much more.It’s not here yet though, so what did I get up to this week?  Lots of catching up on emails and Slack messages on Monday  Onboarded a designer new to the team  Booked travel and hotels for upcoming events  Unfortunately realised I can’t afford to make the International Design in Government meet-up  Ran the fortnightly team reflection session  Wrote some thoughts on where RICE prioritisation would and wouldn’t be useful for the design system and GOV.‌UK Frontend  Updated the Design System Day page with some of the sessions you can join, and whipped up a code of conduct  Gave some feedback to the team for their mid-year feedback reviews  Ran show &amp; tell and sprint planning, and joined retro  Spoke to CDDO about the cross-gov Slack pilot and our involvement in proving the value  Enabled message activity on the #govuk-design-system channel on cross-government Slack, so we can analyse the effectiveness of our messaging  Had a chat about RICE prioritisation, which moved up a few gears to the convo we really needed: setting aside time to do strategy work properly instead of trying to parallelise it with delivery work (we don’t have the capacity)  Prepared for check-in with our senior management team  Meet with Hopin’s customer success folks, the platform we’re using for Design System Day, so we can purchase the right subscription tier  Prepare for and lead an alpha service assessment (last-minute thing for a big programme)  Have a couple of one-to-onesGiven I’m writing these on Friday morning, what will I do today?  Finish up the roles and responsibilities for volunteers on day 2 of Design System Day  Write our team weeknote for the programme’s weeknote email  Have some catch-ups with folks on the team and my contract manager  Check in with our senior management team  Start writing some questions for a fireside talk I’ll run on Design System Day’s second day (very excited about this one)Tracking workLast week I started using Roger’s system for tracking work and keeping focus so that I could stay on top of tasks, make sure I’m working towards the right goals, and to introduce feedback loops into working month.I can’t summarise the entire week yet as it hasn’t finished, but I can tally up the week so far.So far I’ve completed 27 tasks, with an even split between planned and unplanned tasks. My achievement rate is 50% again: I’ve achieved 3 of my 6 weekly goals, progressed 1 other goal, but 2 weekly goals I haven’t touched. But 1 of those goals is less relevant now, so I can descope it. The remaining goal isn’t massively urgent and can be done next week, that’s fine.I’m definitely feeling the benefits of this system. The sense of achievement is one thing, but just having a second brain to store it all in is really helping clear my mind.Setting aside time for strategy workOllie surfaced a thought that I’d been feeling, which is that although the team coaching has been fantastic, there’s so much to change, monitor and assess after one of the sessions that we just don’t feel we’ve got the time to do. We’re delivering big missions currently which eat up a lot of brain-space (check the roadmap).Alongside the tweaks to our ways of working, we also need to pool ideas for a more intentional strategy for the design system, one that’ll last for a couple of years. But some of the leads on the team are engaged in that busy delivery work, so pulling them out to think big-picture would be a bruising context-switch.I’m a big believer in slowing down to go fast later, specifically on strategy work. You need the headspace to compute multiple futures, to spot the nascent problems and conflicts in the timelines, so that you can pick a more plausible path. The tweaks to our ways of working are all about adding a little more adaptability and focus, which can be helpful in responding to changes in context or working through emergent problems.So I’d like to set aside most of November for that thinking. It’ll give us time to work on the beginnings of a strategy together, and we can take those assumptions to be validated in a discovery in the new year. It’s pushing plans back slightly but adding more colour, more detail, which will result in a shorter discovery with fewer questions to ask.Putting end-to-end services through the existing assessment processThe last service I assessed was in March this year and I reflected in a weeknote that a service assessment acts a bit like an investor meeting for the organisation. That was a big end-to-end service and trying to cover all the moving parts inside of 4 hours was near impossible.Yesterday I was in a similar assessment with a similarly large end-to-end service. It’s being developed in stages – quite sensible ones – but you need to context of the whole problem (and whole service) in order to understand the slice that’s being brought to you.If you ignore the taxonomy of service assessments in CDDO/GDS world, using instead the description of products and services from NHS Digital, we were assessing an alpha product for a multi-stage end-to-end service. The product gave users an output they’d need to move along the service, but the outcome they were seeking had a few more stages to complete first.4 hours to assess a product is doable. But we need a bit more time to take in the context of the wider service. Allowing assessors that time would make assessments fairer, which might mean fewer Not Mets and quicker delivery for big programmes.I hope someone’s taking a systems-thinking lens to service assessments soon.Fireside talkOK, since you’ve made it this far down my weeknotes, I’ll give you a little treat. On day 2 of Design System Day, I’ll be chatting with Ethan Marcotte about responsive design, modern web design standards, design systems and ‘hyperobjects’. We’re releasing more tickets on Monday, so check the Eventbrite.And if you want to come along to the in-person day in Edinburgh on 10 October, ping me, I’ve got a few tickets!RunningA light week.

It’s being developed in stages – quite sensible ones – but you need to context of the whole problem (and whole service) in order to understand the slice that’s being brought to you.</p><p>If you ignore the taxonomy of service assessments in CDDO/GDS world, using instead the <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/design-matters/2022/products-deliver-outputs-services-deliver-outcomes\">description of products and services from NHS Digital</a>, we were assessing an alpha product for a multi-stage end-to-end service. The product gave users an output they’d need to move along the service, but the outcome they were seeking had a few more stages to complete first.</p><p>4 hours to assess a product is doable. But we need a bit more time to take in the context of the wider service. Allowing assessors that time would make assessments fairer, which might mean fewer Not Mets and quicker delivery for big programmes.</p><p>I hope someone’s taking a systems-thinking lens to service assessments soon.</p><h2 id=\"fireside-talk\">Fireside talk</h2><p>OK, since you’ve made it this far down my weeknotes, I’ll give you a little treat. On day 2 of Design System Day, I’ll be chatting with <a href=\"https://ethanmarcotte.com\">Ethan Marcotte</a> about responsive design, modern web design standards, design systems and ‘hyperobjects’. We’re releasing more tickets on Monday, so <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/design-system-day-2023-online-ticket-tickets-714592022977\">check the Eventbrite</a>.</p><p>And if you want to come along to the in-person day in Edinburgh on 10 October, <a href=\"(/contact)\">ping me</a>, I’ve got a few tickets!</p><h2 id=\"running\">Running</h2><p>A light week. Trialled running with a local club which was fun, a 13K jaunt through the suburbs and hills of south Croydon. Nice people. Will give one of their Sunday morning trail sessions a try too.</p><h2 id=\"pizza\">Pizza</h2><p>In other news, I am refining my <em>pizzaiolo</em> skills. Last weekend I cranked out some decent porchetta, fig and blue cheese pizzas. The dough was baked just right but the crusts were a little too puffy. Might benefit from being wider. And I’m overdoing it with the toppings…but who doesn’t want boatloads of cheese?</p><h2 id=\"bookmarks\">Bookmarks</h2><ul>  <li><a href=\"https://hidde.blog/interactions-about-accessibility/\">Ableist interactions</a>, 5 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://on.ft.com/46bcJ8K\">The plot to smash the Conservative party</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2023/09/17/weeknote-sunday-17-september-2023/\">Weeknote, Sunday 17 September 2023</a>, 5 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://evanjconrad.com/posts/product-abstraction\">How to do product positioning</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725237/iphone-personal-voice-speak-training-accessibility\">iPhones will be able to speak in your voice with 15 minutes of training</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2023/09/18/candidate-simulator/\">Candidate simulator</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://nicolasbouliane.com/projects/anmeldung-form-filler\">Anmeldung form filler Built in 2023</a>, 3 mins</li>  <li><a href=\"https://chosen-path.org/2023/09/19/so-you-want-to-transform-public-services/\">So, you want to transform public services?</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/online-safety-bill-passes/\">House of Lords Passes U.K. Online Safety Bill, Which Is Still Very Bad</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/18/luddites-social-technology-visionaries/\">I’ve always loved tech.

How did it go?I made sure to use the time at the start of each day to plan what I was going to do, which is the main improvement I wanted to make. Success! Tracking my tasks throughout the day was OK, I kept a Notion page open to remind me to fill it in. But I did occasionally forget.

Perhaps it’s an over-optimisation though, another notification to add to a lifetime full of pings.In total I completed 17 tasks, most of those were planned but 5 were unplanned tasks that popped up. My achievement rate was 50%, as I achieved 3 of the 6 goals I set for the week. The 3 goals I didn’t achieve have been bumped to next week, as more important and urgent things came up, and these 3 goals didn’t need to happen this week.

My bad: I’ll be more careful with setting myself work to do outside the team.Feels like a good system so far!Design system impactDavid and I gave a talk at the GDS Get Together on Friday on the subject of impact. Instead of showing a bunch of slides with numbers on, we told the story of how the GOV.‌UK Design System influences organisations across the UK public sector and globally. And how we focus more on making impact through multiplier effects.We’re not just here to build components and patterns. We needed to do a lot of that in the early years, but now we make more impact through multiplier effects: like modernising our conventions on JavaScript, assessing how new accessibility criteria for WCAG 2.2 will affect UI design, updating components and patterns in response, and running community workshops to share knowledge and improve skills across the Civil Service.And we don’t just look after a product or service. We’re part of an active global conversation on how people use the web. We feed back into accessibility working groups and technical specifications, we raise bugs with browser vendors, and we influence many international organisations – including W3C’s design system.It makes sense having a centralised team doing this at scale, for the benefit of service teams and users. There’s diminishing returns on us adding more and more components to the design system, so I’m going to look at how we can better enable our community to do this (and iterate what they add).Our team’s best work is at the system level, and there are plenty of teams innovating, creating new components and patterns for the GOV.‌UK ecosystem. There’s some work to do in shifting perceptions, as we’re some times seen as a design authority – but our purpose is design enabler.Anyway, lots of work to do. I’m shaping a discovery and discussions with teams in the run up to Design System Day, so will have more to say on this later.Shared spacesIn the Before Times, we’d put posters up on the wall. We’d huddle around a TV during standup, we’d stick things on our desks, and we’d scribble on whiteboards as part of our work. But that all happens inside tools now. Those tools look different for each person on the team, and there’s no shared front page. The sense of team unity and having a shared space becomes fractured.So I asked the team what we might do to rekindle that sense of unity in a way that embraces hybrid remote-first working.There were lots of great ideas including stickers, desktop backgrounds, desk toys, internal blogs and podcasts for team memories, NPC team-mates, and ways to personalise our sanitary, functional project boards.That last one is a big one. Why are JIRA, GitHub Projects, Linear and other project management solutions so lifeless and devoid of character? With Trello we could add backgrounds to boards, but what about team photos, stickers, posters and other personal items.

Heck, when someone asks me for estimations, I know it could be useful but it still feels…off.My approach is to explain how estimation is a useful exercise and how the estimates will be used. This makes it feel less grubby, and there’s other little rules that help prevent estimation from being misused.Here’s what I’ve learned so far about estimating software projects. This is a living list that I’ll revisit and add to over time, so let me know if there’s anything I’ve missed or got wrong.Rules for estimating software projectsThe first rule of estimation is that accurate estimation is an oxymoron. Think in 2-week blocks, not days. Don‘t get in the weeds working out how many hours something will take. Use a broad brush.The second rule is that the process can be more valuable than the output (like roadmapping). Figuring out the stages of a project and the work we need to do is more enlightening than knowing how long it could take, as it allows you to identify essential work you might not have considered. Good communication is more important than good estimation.The third rule is explain how the estimation will be used. It could be that you need to plan releases, or make sure something‘s ready for/before a policy/legislation/regulation deadline, or align with another team‘s work, or work out how much of a bottleneck we‘ll have because we don‘t have enough of X role. You never need to know when something will be done for knowing‘s sake, so don‘t hide it from your team-mates. Be honest.The fourth rule is that there are always undiscovered tasks. Until you‘ve uncovered all the unknowns, scoped a project (decided what to do now and what to do in later iterations) and made all the big decisions, you‘ll never know how much work there truly is to do. Which includes beta stages where you‘re collecting feedback – you don‘t know what‘s gonna come up. Timeboxing is better than estimation for discovery and alpha, but once you‘re at the beta building stage, that‘s when estimations are useful.The fifth rule is revisit your estimations regularly. Things change, all the time (including your mood). It‘s also motivating to tick things off and mark them as complete, to step back and see progress made on a big project.The sixth and final rule: never use estimates against people. There are too many external factors that negatively impact our productivity. If something took longer than we thought it might and it‘s a problem, dig into why. Your processes and organisation are probably more to blame than the people doing the work.",

One highlight was sailing from Cabo de Palos to La Manga, just in time to enter the marina as they raised the bridge for the final time that day. We anchored off of an island in the Mar Menor, a coastal lagoon, for a restful night in nature.And I need to talk about Restaurante Salzillo in Murcia. It’s an absolute dream. Chefs work behind a bar, which you can dine at (a bit like Barrafina), and there’s a large, glass-fronted refrigerator stocked with some of the sweetest prawns and seafood you’ve ever had. Plenty of good Spanish food and wine. I was in heaven. We had clams, octopus, artichokes, John Dory, tuna, and a lovely Albariño. My postres was unique: paparajote, a battered lemon leaf dipped in sugar and cinnamon. Very delicate flavours.This week I was back to work, and amongst many other things I haven’t noted down, I  caught up on a bunch of emails and Slack messages  joined an asynchronous research analysis session (super well organised)  chatted about the rollout of the new crown  joined the usual team ceremonies (show &amp; tell, retro, planning)  added expiry dates to our team playbook, so that we keep it up-to-date  joined a retro on the recent programme-wide roadmapping process  planned some follow-up actions from our recent coaching session  collaborated on a presentation for the GDS Get Together next week  sought guidance from our designers on what work would be suitable for a new joiner  caught up on the planning of Design System Day 2023 (tickets available on Monday!)  shared thoughts on what our next coaching session might contain  met our new associate delivery manager  caught up with our deputy director  thought a lot about our future strategy, which needs adding to my notes  had a check-in with our senior management team  prepared a new system for tracking goals and tasks  caught up on the WCAG 2.2 epic and discussed how we might mitigate a bottleneck  had a career chat with a product manager from NHS England  started refining the thesis of our presentation for the GDS Get TogetherTreading waterA couple of times this week I said ‘I feel like I’m treading water’, which means I feel like I’m just about managing to keep on top of things. Weeknoting is helping by giving me time to reflect on the week, but if I’m still feeling like too much is going on, something else is amiss. My current theory is that it’s because I’m not setting goals and tracking my tasks well enough.That’s silly because each morning I have time to set my daily goals, I just don’t do it. Sure, I block out my calendar for certain tasks and I stash things in Slack reminders for later, but I don’t know whether all that busyness is laddering up to achieving my main objectives.So I’m going to try Roger’s system for tracking work and keeping focus, it looks like it’ll be a big help.I don’t think it’s anything to do with being the only product person on a team of 17 people (with two squads). Other teams of a similar size in our programme have more product managers, but I see our lead frontend developer, our community designer and our accessibility specialist as playing a product role too. My job is to tie it all together into a coherent strategy.Asking for estimatesAsking for estimations of when a project might be complete feels grubby. It shouldn‘t have to, but no one likes it. Heck, when someone asks me for estimations, I know it could be useful but it still feels…off.My approach usually is to explain how it‘s a useful exercise and how the estimation will be used, but I didn‘t do that a couple of weeks ago. I got uncomfortable and skipped over it, just saying I needed an estimate of when the project might finish, and it irked a colleague. Calling that out as a mistake I made, because there is value in estimation.I’ve written up some light rules for estimation off the back of this.Retros as an attack vectorWe start each retrospective with the Agile Prime Directive: everyone did their best under the circumstances. That‘s supposed to set the tone, so that people can discuss issues openly, with empathy, to find a solution together. But some times this doesn‘t happen and it can feel like someone‘s complaining about you, right in front of you, without saying explicitly that you‘re the problem.Sure, you‘re not supposed to make it personal or take it personally. But it‘s hard not to be human.One guideline I find useful for making feedback constructive instead of critical is to suggest remedial actions or solutions whenever I raise a problem or issue. This thing could have been better, and here‘s a suggestion for how.There is a time and a place for critical feedback, and it‘s usually in a one-to-one meeting, not in a group setting.Maybe agreeing some norms around retro hygiene would be good, rather than continuing to rely on the Agile Prime Directive. Its intent is right but when you‘re too familiar with a phrase, it‘s easy to ignore.First marathonTomorrow I‘m running my first marathon. 42km across the Shropshire hills with 1,000m of elevation.

The team went over the principles that Imran, Kelly and I set back in April and rated which ones we were doing best at and which ones we had room to grow on. We reviewed the answers as a team and many people thought we could do better on ‘Transfer power’, which is fair enough as we’ve only made a dent as a collective.Everyone thought we were doing well on ‘Progress, don’t perfect’, which initially I wasn’t sure about. But then Stefan asked us to think about examples or reasons we answered the way we did. And as I thought about it, I realised the team had done a fair bit on that principle recently. Which made me feel bad for not realising it sooner…but I felt great about the progress the team has made.Next up Kelly ran a workshop we put together on roles and responsibilities. The team have been wanting to know what their roles are, where they fit in, what they should and shouldn’t do, and we wanted to address that. But I didn’t want to tell them because I believe they know. So instead, we read through the DDaT profiles for each role and marked down things we knew we were expected to do and things we weren’t sure about. We went through the ‘Not sures’ as a team and either clarified a responsibility or put a pin in it, to come back to it later.After lunch, I ran a workshop on our contribution &amp; product development model and where people fit in. Using our iterated model as a base, I asked each discipline on the team to note down whether they had a driving role, a supporting role, or needed awareness only at each stage of the model. It was pretty much bang on, although there’s a couple of opportunities to downgrade roles (from supporting to needing awareness) and create some co-driving.Once that was done, I asked each discipline to note down their top two needs from other disciplines in order to do their job well. I wish we’d had more time for this as we could only cover the top need, but people were able to sign tacit contracts with each other or ask for more clarity. We must revisit that workshop and nail it down, as it’s going to make multidisciplinary working so much smoother.What it takes to run the design systemRight now I’d say the team is working close to full capacity. Some tweaks to processes will help but it’s mere optimisation for marginal gains. The GOV.‌UK Design System is a well-adopted, mature design system – it’s in a great place! – hence the demands on our team. But the backlog is years long, we don’t have time to review and iterate the existing catalogue, and managing the community needs a small team itself.To scale the Design System to meet the demands placed on it, we’re going to need to distribute and devolve governance and assurance. And that’s a big experiment. If it doesn’t work or it’s not sustainable, the team will need to grow. Not by many, maybe 3 or 4 people, but that’s a bigger budget when purse strings are tightening.Open source, maintenance and communitiesJess is a staff product manager at GitHub and looked after the Sponsorship and Maintainer products until a recent restructure, so I wanted to find out if she’s come across any best practice with sustaining community contributions for open source software. She had tons of advice, and thankfully a lot of it validated what we’re already doing.Documentation needs to be tight, making it clear you want help is a must, and making community contributions sustainable is a decades old problem no one has really solved. But by continuing to believe in and add effort to the cause, we might just crack it one day.Interface guidelinesApple’s design language is 40 years old, so it was great to get some hunches confirmed (and a few tips to boot) from Mike and Linda on the Human Interface Guidelines team.There is a paradigm shift in GOV.‌UK’s design language soon, from static web-based experiences to dynamic multichannel experiences. The challenge is keeping the look and feel, the brand, consistent while meeting many of the expectations and constraints put on our 10-year-old design language. It’ll happen slowly. Ideally you won’t realise it’s happening. Boring magic and that.We can help make that happen but also we mustn’t get in the way of teams innovating. So it was helpful to learn from what kind of things work well. Quelle suprise, a strong design community of practice helps maintain consistency, but so can designing new capabilities for our service.I made many notes in that chat but don’t have them to hand, so I’ll add them at a later date.Bookmarks  Welcome to 404 Media, 5 mins  What are digital public goods and the DPGA?, 3 mins  Reflections on the government’s Digital Transformation Roadmap, 4 mins  Digital Public Goods Standard, 7 mins  Laying the Foundation for the Future: Open Source Sustainability and the Adoption of Digital Public Goods  “It’s hard to collaborate with architects” says Longchamp’s Sophie Delafontaine, 5 mins  Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg talks future of Tumblr, with algorithmic choice, AI enhancements and more, 5 mins  Books for Design Beginners  In Business, ‘Flat’ Structures Rarely Work.

Should have done it sooner.There was a good talk run by UCL’s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose towards the end of January that looked at why innovation needs bureaucracy. The event accompanied the launch of a book that looks at ‘agile stability’: “that in order to successfully innovate, state organisations have to move nimbly like start-ups and yet ensure stability at the same time.”Amongst the academic chatter that, to be honest, often went over my head, there were examples shared of what that ‘agile stability’ means. Rules or principles that guide people, which I’ve written about before. Not a playbook or a step-by-step, but some guardrails that keep you on track while giving space for creativity. For innovation.My guess is that that was the intention of the Service Standard. It encourages teams to build services in a user-centred, iterative way. A service assessment then gives teams the opportunity to tell the story of how they utilised those methods.The thing is, despite everyone’s best efforts to avoid this and reframe service assessments as friendly reviews by digital peers, there is a culture of fear amongst service teams. And I think this stifles creativity and innovation.I’ve been working on the GOV.UK Design System for just shy of 3 months now, and we receive frequent questions about needing ‘sign off’ or ‘approval’ to do things. For example, if you’re looking for a date picker to include in your service, the GOV.UK Design System doesn’t have one. But Digital Scotland does. So we were asked what sign-off was needed to use it.None. You don’t need any approval.Sure, you’ll get asked about using the design system in alpha and beta assessments, but you don’t have to. (There are many reasons why you should, but there are reasons why teams don’t.) And if you haven’t designed or implemented an accessible component, this will get picked up in an accessibility audit. But so will everything else.What’s most interesting in this example is that the team asking about sign-off were working on a live service. Digging in to their thought patterns, they realised that there wasn’t a service assessment or anything similar to go through. They had been worried about being ‘pulled up’ on using a non-GOV.UK component, but realised there wasn’t a moment when they would be policed on this.This is one example in a pattern of questions about ‘GDS approved’ ways of doing things. It signals a culture of fear, where people find it hard to do their job for fear of misstepping.Another example: my service owner at NHS Digital was petrified of the alpha service assessment. They thought that if they failed the assessment, the service would be stopped. This caused them to focus more on boxes to tick in order to pass, rather than thinking about what good looked like, what our priorities should be, and how to empower teams to do their best work.This doesn’t feel good. Constraints should encourage creativity, not stifle it. When people feel they need to tick boxes, they’re not in the right headspace to innovate. To make government services radically better.We need to address the dogma, otherwise it’ll be damaging in the long-run. For an organisation that professes the benefits of open-working, agility, and co-design, it hasn’t done too well at creating psychological safety in the system.The bureaucracy got too much. It has its uses, but we need to rebalance it to encourage more agility, more innovation. I don’t know how just yet – others have suggested how to rethink the phases – but I’m sure we can figure it out.",
