Nothing of note to report really, this week was filled with rechecking our delivery plan and making sure we had everything we needed. The research date has moved back by a week but thatâ€™s it.</p><p>We did whittle our seven design hypotheses down into two though, so that was good. A narrower scope means we should be able to move on to other work in January.</p><h2 id="things-i-started">Things I started</h2><p>Had quite a few conversations with partner services about their needs this week, new features or functionality we could add.</p><h2 id="some-puzzles">Some puzzles</h2><p>Having pulled together some top-line KPIs, my colleagues presented these in our check-in with senior management, which was a puzzle from a few weeks ago. Iâ€™d like to see how it went.</p><h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2><p>I lost steam with NaBloPoMo, but would like to write some more considered posts. Hereâ€™s an <a href="/2020/11/01/nablopomo-2020">index of blog posts from National Blog Writing Month 2020</a>.</p><p>Benâ€™s <a href="https://noisydecentgraphics.typepad.com/design/2020/11/rdi-insights-talk-tuesday-night.html">talk with Michael Marriott</a>, the furniture and product designer, about boring magic was really good. It was fun just hearing two people kick about and find inspiration in a phrase that had helped our thoughts crystallise too.</p><p>Earlier in the week I was reading William Morrisâ€™s lectures on useful work versus useless toil and â€˜the lesser artsâ€™, which struck a chord during the talk. When Ben was talking about the open source movement possibly having a place in design, it reminded me of Morrisâ€™s talking about decoration, â€˜the lesser artâ€™, and how everyone could take a delight in making a bowl. Everyone shares the same basic method but has opportunity to augment and extend as they please.</p><p>Then on Thursday I watched the Design Museumâ€™s talk on <a href="https://designmuseum.org/whats-on/talks-courses-and-workshops-3/the-spirit-of-rave-event">the spirit of rave</a>, exploring the legacy of rave culture on art and design. It was good, but watching people have a chat over video after youâ€™ve spent several hours doing the same is tiresome. I found myself wanting for the virtual reality experiences mentioned on rave flyers. Wouldnâ€™t it be weird if the one thing that pushed Facebookâ€™s VR experiments into the mainstream was the pandemic. It is actually like weâ€™re living inside a sci-fi plot sometimes. (Read <em>Ubik</em> by the way, I loved it.)</p><p>Anyway, I bought a wet suit on Monday and have been swimming twice, so hoping to spend more time outdoors. The sea is wonderful and being tossed about in stormy waters is fun.</p><h2 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.furthermore.co.uk/what-to-do-in-lockdown">What to do in lockdown: Top 5 immersive experiences and why they work</a>, 5 mins</li><li><a href="https://kevq.uk/a-nod-to-the-90s-web/">ðŸ’¾ A Nod To The 90s Web</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2020/11/02/whats-left-when-the-cookie-goes-away/">Whatâ€™s left when the cookie goes away?</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="http://babylonwales.blogspot.com/2012/01/independent-tropical-wales.html">Independent Tropical Wales</a>, 1 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/29/neoprene-and-afterdrop-how-to-keep-swimming-outside-this-winter">Neoprene and afterdrop: how to keep swimming outside this winter</a>, 4 mins</li><li><a href="https://blog.joepairman.com/2020/08/03/take-notes-as-online-help-for-your-creative-future-self/">Take notes as online help for your creative future self</a>, 12 mins</li><li><a href="https://breder.org/3/">Reading for Remembering</a>, 2 mins</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/school-of-planning/structuring-strategic-storytelling-5b2afb1a4486">Structuring strategic storytelling</a>, 5 mins</li><li><a href="https://academy.nobl.io/how-to-conduct-a-11/">How to Conduct a 1:1</a>, 2 mins</li><li><a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/eu/news-briefs/mastercard-lights-up-london-and-bristol-to-raise-awareness-for-people-who-feel-left-in-the-dark/">Mastercard lights up London and Bristol to raise awareness for people who feel left â€˜In The Darkâ€™</a>, 6 mins</li><li><a href="https://digitalpeople.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/27/digital-presenteeism/">Digital Presenteeism</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/04/dorset-mega-henge-stone-age">Dorset mega henge may be â€˜last hurrahâ€™ of stone-age builders</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://tobiogunsina.com/this-is-how-i-work-give-or-take/">This is how I workâ€¦give or take</a>, 11 mins</li><li><a href="https://on.ft.com/2IBppjq">Johnson tells Cummings to leave Downing St immediately</a>, 5 mins</li><li><a href="https://on.ft.com/36D36Ck">Cummings thrived on animosity but lost battle for power</a>, 4 mins</li></ul><span class="meta"><time datetime="2020-11-15T00:00:00+00:00">15 November 2020</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/weeknotes">Weeknotes</a></span></section></main><footer> Copyright Sustainability Privacy Website carbon Feed</footer></body></html>
