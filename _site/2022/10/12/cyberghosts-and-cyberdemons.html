It’s a super fun prospect.</p><p>The devs at GOV.UK harrumphed when I mentioned looking after a server: as you would when you’ve been at the sharp end of nginx timeouts and unauthorised access for a decade or two. But it’s an exciting concept for an amateur nerd like me.</p><p>Matt said:</p><blockquote><p>I want to feel like my room is haunted by miniature cyberghosts whenever someone reads my blog!</p></blockquote><p>Which reminds me of when folks at <a href="https://simpleweb.co.uk/">Simpleweb</a> added a secret page to their site that allowed you to fire small Nerf darts at people in the office. And a site in the early 2000s when someone pointed a webcam at a CRT monitor you could send messages to. Most people sent rude messages. Or the time a family in south-east England (it was Kent or Essex; it was 2008, I can’t remember) dotted webcams around their kitchen and broadcast everything on justin.tv –￼ a neighbour found out and published their phone number online, so the household had to endure multiple phone-based pranks.</p><p>All right, I’ll hold my hands up. At least 6 pizzas have arrived at homes visible in the livestream of Abbey Road because of me. It was a waste and it was silly, but Domino’s system was very exploitable when it was all cash-on-delivery.</p><p>As much as I’d like to experience the murmurations of cyberghosts, is the idea of inviting cyberdemons just as fun? Based on the examples above, as soon as you introduce a webcam, the cyberdemons could come along.</p><p>Having said that, part of the fun is experiencing those cyberdemons. The merry pranksters with their hypertext fool-aid acid test.</p><p>You can only protect against so much. Buy the ticket, take the ride.</p><p>It’d be interesting to see how the proclivity to prank an internet-connected situation defines the generational divides of Internet natives.</p><p>Inviting cyberghosts into your home is a well-meaning pursuit to connect with other beings, albeit in a limited and one-directional way. Having grown up in the generation that followed, a lot of us wanted connection but we also played with exploiting the bounds of that (remember <a href="https://loosejoints.biz/products/card-stand">the card stand thing</a>?). Now, you’ve got people making money from those connections on YouTube and Twitch, inviting their cyberghosts to become more real, to be in the room.</p><p>We all want connection online, and a good way to feel that is to bring the bits in the cloud closer. It’d be interesting to make that bi-directional. You can write in my guestbook and that will projected onto my bedroom wall, but in return I get to fire little foam darts off your mantelpiece while you’re watching telly.</p><p>The multiverse can wait. What about the interconnected playground we could build right here, in this universe?</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2022-10-12T08:30:57+01:00">12 October 2022</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/notes">Notes</a></span></section></main><footer> Copyright Sustainability Privacy Website carbon Feed</footer></body></html>
