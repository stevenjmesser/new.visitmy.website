<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I’m Steve. For the day job I’m a digital product manager and I’m looking for my next role after working on the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk" target="_blank">GOV.UK Design System</a>. But here’s some other <a href="{{ "/now" | relative_url }}">things I’m doing now</a>.</p>

<p>You might be interested to read what I’ve written about <a href="{{ "/tag/product-management" | relative_url }}">product management</a>. Often I’ll write weeknotes about my work and my personal life. You can read my <a href="{{ "/tag/weeknotes" | relative_url }}">weeknotes</a>, or check out <a href="{{ "/topics" | relative_url }}">other topics I write about</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to know a little more about my background, <a href="{{ "/about" | relative_url }}">read about me</a> or <a href="{{ "/work" | relative_url }}">check out my portfolio</a>.</p>
