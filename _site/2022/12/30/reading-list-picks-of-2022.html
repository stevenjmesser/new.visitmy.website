The tally of things I read dropped compared to previous years and I found myself hunting out articles based on need, rather than just working through my list of saved things. So there’s more on product management and digital delivery, fewer diverse topics than previous years.</p><ul><li><a href="#product-management--design">Product management &amp; design</a></li><li><a href="#digital-teams">Digital teams</a></li><li><a href="#internet-ways-of-being">Internet ways of being</a></li><li><a href="#working-in-the-open">Working in the open</a></li><li><a href="#divided-kingdom">Divided Kingdom</a></li><li><a href="#just-good-pieces">Just good pieces</a></li></ul><h2 id="product-management--design">Product management &amp; design</h2><h3 id="dont-confuse-these-12-shortcuts-with-iteration">Don’t confuse these 12 shortcuts with iteration</h3><p>Over the last 2 years I’ve been using the phrase ‘scope hammer’ a lot, which is when I’m looking to reduce the amount of effort we put in to building something, working down to the irreducible core. That’s because I’ve been working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">0-to-1</a> situations, getting something off the ground, when moving fast helps. These principles on iteration from GitLab are really helpful in not shaving off the wrong kinds of work.</p><p>Read <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/12/01/dont-confuse-these-twelve-shortcuts-with-iteration/">Don’t confuse these 12 shortcuts with iteration</a>, 6 mins</p><h3 id="how-to-be-a-trusted-agitator">How to be a trusted agitator</h3><p>When you become more senior in your role, you start interacting with the management and leadership layers of an organisation more. The way I work is like an agitator, or a catalyst, and the tactics that worked in teams don’t always suit the leaders. So I’m working on how to be a more trusted character. This piece from Laura Yarrow is a corker.</p><p>Read <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/05/how-to-be-a-trusted-agitator/">How to be a trusted agitator</a>, 4 mins</p><h3 id="on-principles">On Principles</h3><p>I’ve long thought that a good set of principles can carry you very far. Principles inspire action, help you make decisions, set boundaries and guide you. When I was head of product at a startup, I wrote a set of principles for the team, which were referred to often. James Boardwell has written about how he created some principles on a team at Ministry of Justice.</p><p>Read <a href="https://technogoggles.com/2022/06/21/on-principles/">On Principles</a>, 3 mins</p><h3 id="products-deliver-outputs-services-deliver-outcomes">Products deliver outputs, services deliver outcomes</h3><p>If you orient your work around meeting users’ needs and improving their experience, the semantic debate over what is a service and what is a product feels like a moot point. A product mindset and the tenets of user-centred service design are the same. But for organisations going through digital transformation and not fully understanding all the lingo, definitions can help. This definition from Tero Väänänen is really useful, and the diagram helped me explain our service to technology-minded stakeholders at NHS Digital. (I also like the idea of platforms as enabling services.)</p><p>Read <a href="https://medium.com/@teropsv/products-deliver-outputs-services-deliver-outcomes-845f964ba1ff">Products deliver outputs, services deliver outcomes</a>, 7 mins</p><h3 id="10-good-design-reads-that-arent-written-by-white-men">10 good design reads that aren’t written by white men</h3><p>Does what it says on the tin.</p><p>Read <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/10-good-design-reads-that-arent-written-by-white-men-58943255d04e">10 good design reads that aren’t written by white men</a>, 10 mins</p><h3 id="list-of-inclusive-design-books">List of inclusive design books</h3><p>A similar list from Benjy Stanton that’s all about doing design inclusively.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.benjystanton.co.uk/blog/list-of-inclusive-design-books/">List of inclusive design books</a>, 2 mins</p><h3 id="why-figma-is-selling-to-adobe-for-20-billion">Why Figma is selling to Adobe for $20 billion</h3><p>This is a great, in-depth interview with Figma’s CEO. Their sale to Adobe is almost beside the point, or at least it doesn’t seem to be the focus of Dylan Field. He cares more about building a product to meet its vision and enabling an organisation around that. If you’re interested in product strategy, jobs-to-be-done as a lens for growth, and web standards at the heart of a product, I reckon you’ll get a kick out of this.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23445821/figma-adobe-acquisition-design-vr-ai-meta">Why Figma is selling to Adobe for $20 billion</a>, 53 mins</p><h2 id="digital-teams">Digital teams</h2><h3 id="what-do-we-know-about-time-pressure-in-software-development">What Do We Know About Time Pressure in Software Development?</h3><p>Some times you’ll need to work to a strict deadline when shipping software. Launching an MVP, for example, or meeting a regulatory change. The problem with deadline-driven development is that it makes people think that deadlines are a good thing, that you’ll always ship great software when working under time pressure. This literature review shows how though time pressure <em>can</em> be useful, it is negative in the long run.</p><p>Read <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2021/05/09184214/1mLHZkBtQiI">What Do We Know About Time Pressure in Software Development?</a>, 10 mins</p><h3 id="shipping-great-work">Shipping Great Work</h3><p>Being the first product manager at a startup basically means you’re the delivery manager too. Although I think I’ve got a really good grasp of the role and how to deliver software, there’s an added pressure when you’re doing all the product thinking, the design <em>and</em> you’re looking after delivery. This was a great resource covering many of the activities that go in to shipping great software beyond adopting something like Scrum or Kanban.</p><p>Read <a href="https://koolaidfactory.com/zines/shipping-great-work/">Shipping Great Work</a>, 30 mins</p><h3 id="how-big-tech-runs-tech-projects-and-the-curious-absence-of-scrum">How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum</h3><p>Most teams I’ve worked on have used Scrum or Scrumban, and though it was all the rage over a decade ago, times have changed. At the startup I had the opportunity to weigh up different approaches, and this piece provided a really useful input, helping me see how other teams ship good software quickly. (Hot take: I think that mature digital teams in the public sector should drop Scrum.)</p><p>Read <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/project-management-in-tech">How Big Tech Runs Tech Projects and the Curious Absence of Scrum</a>, 23 mins</p><h3 id="how-to-disappoint-people">How to disappoint people</h3><p>The idea that ‘every project starts with a fixed amount of disappointment’ was a real mind-blown moment for me. Too often I’ve kidded myself into thinking we’ll pull it off. This is a more realistic framing, one that works particularly well on teams with low strategic autonomy. If you’re handed some ideas to build or very specific goals to reach, this set of posts from Neil Vass will likely be helpful.

It’s about the culture wars, although it’s really about how that’s too simple a definition.
