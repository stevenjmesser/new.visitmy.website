Yes, there are loads of meetings that could have been emails. Yes, spending a lot of time on video is draining. Yes, we have to try and juggle thinking with doing. Yes, some types of thinking are best not done in-person.</p><p>But I don’t think meetings are inherently bad. Or that every time people get together it’s a meeting, sometimes it’s a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/workshops-vs-meetings/">workshop</a>. There’s nuance to all this. So I don’t think meetings should always be spoken about negatively.</p><p>We <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/">experimented with getting rid of meetings</a> when I was on GOV.UK Pay, and the results were really interesting. The experiment helped us understand that nuance, so that we could better design methods for making decisions, collaborating on designs, sharing information and collecting thoughts.</p><p>Coincidentally, Elizabeth Ayer from 18F published a post on why meetings <em>are</em> integral to knowledge work (see the bookmarks below), which was good because it was rooted in research. Good timing too. I don’t think it drew a divide on synchronous and asynchronous meetings, which is fine because a lot of what she’s saying applies to both styles of communication (in my opinion).</p><p>Anyway, I guess this is ground we’ll probably re-tread in every team over the next few years. Or perhaps forever. And that’s fair, right? Each team is staffed with individuals, individual styles and individual lives.</p><p>Let’s design our ways of working intentionally, to help us balance our work and our real lives.</p><h2 id="broadcast-versus-engagement">Broadcast versus engagement</h2><p>In the directorate town hall I asked about how some governance processes were being redesigned. The meeting last week where deputy directors read roadmaps back to teams was badged as a way to create more accountability and look sideways across the directorate. Which is fair. But, to be honest, it came out of the blue and felt like it wouldn’t achieve more accountability on its own. There had to be other changes in mind, surely?</p><p>For what it’s worth, I think it’s a good thing in general. We have our <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/roadmap/">roadmap</a>, <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues">backlog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/53/views/36">sprint board</a> available openly. And I’m a giant nerd who writes about work at 6 p.m. on a Thursday.</p><p>There had been some changes to the directorate weeknote meaning teams didn’t have as much space to tell the stories of their work, that everything they shared had to be focussed around directorate objectives. Again, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it does reduce teams’ ability to look sideways – which I challenged our director on.</p><p>Tom Dolan, legend that he is, stepped in with a good point. He said how we probably need to design these practices to be about engagement, not just broadcast. Which was really salient. Which made me think: what if everything we’re doing to be transparent is a broadcast without any engagement? Radio waves pulsing out into the ether, without anyone listening.</p><p>Our sprint board is open but who’s holding us to account except ourselves?</p><p>One to ponder.</p><h2 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.leaningforward.com/blog/2023/02/weeknote-17th-feb-go-east/">Weeknote 17th Feb – Go East</a>, 6 mins</li><li><a href="https://petafloptimism.com/2023/02/19/reckonsgpt-call-my-bluffbot/">ReckonsGPT / Call My Bluffbot</a>, 1 min</li><li><a href="https://blog.mattedgar.com/2023/02/19/weeknote-13-to-17-february-2023/">Weeknote: 13 to 17 February 2023</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/02/meanwhile-in-the-desert-of-the-real/">Meanwhile, in the Desert of the Real</a>, 1 min</li><li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Feb/20/this-ai-chatbot-sidney-is-misbehaving-nov-23-2022-microsoft-comm/">This AI chatbot “Sidney” is misbehaving</a>, 1 min</li><li><a href="https://linear.app/change">Last Year You Said Next Year</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/notes-dot-jim-nielsen-dot-com/">Introducing: notes.jim-nielsen.com</a>, 2 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.foundbyfew.com/blog/return-of-the-blue-chip">Return of the Blue Chip?</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/12/12/making-the-gov-uk-frontend-typography-scale-more-accessible/">Making the GOV.UK Frontend typography scale more accessible</a>, 4 mins</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@ElizAyer/meetings-are-the-work-9e429dde6aa3">Meetings <em>are</em> the work</a>, 13 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.vickyteinaki.com/blog/being-a-responsible-service-assessor/">Being a responsible Service Standard assessor</a>, 7 mins</li></ul><span class="meta"><time datetime="2023-02-23T18:16:02+00:00">23 February 2023</time> &middot; <a href="/tag/weeknotes">Weeknotes</a></span></section></main><footer> Copyright Sustainability Privacy Website carbon Feed</footer></body></html>
