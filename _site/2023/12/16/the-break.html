Almost decided not to write any this week because Iâ€™m tired. Itâ€™s sure is December, huh?</p><p>Iâ€™ve not been tracking my tasks like usual because itâ€™s been a chore, if Iâ€™m honest. This means Iâ€™ve done way more than what Iâ€™ll write about below. But hereâ€™s the half-remembered highlights.</p><ul><li>Introduced our new director to the GOV.â€ŒUK Design System: the why, how and where it makes an impact (a lot of places)</li><li>Convened a meeting of designers and developers in GDS looking at establishing principles for app design (which Iâ€™m calling an assembly, â€˜working groupâ€™ is ðŸ¤¢)</li><li>Took my fellow team leads through the strategic objectives for the year ahead, so that we could come up with next steps together</li><li>Collaborated on a new product model with the team leads, throwing out two-week sprints for longer cycles</li><li>Built and agreed a team leads charter</li><li>Joined the release party for <a href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/changes-to-govuk-frontend-v5/">GOV.â€ŒUK Frontend v5.0.0</a></li><li>Wrote up our experience of bringing in a coach to help with capability development</li><li>Reviewed our accessibility strategy to see what weâ€™d achieved and what weâ€™d need to do in the new year</li><li>Reviewed and updated our accessibility statement, now that v5.0.0 is out</li><li>Did other bitty things in the background while the team had a firebreak</li></ul><h2 id="cycles-not-sprints">Cycles, not sprints</h2><p>Traditional two-week sprints and Scrum provide good training wheels for teams who are new to agile, but I donâ€™t think they work for well established or high performing teams.</p><p>For research and development work (like discovery and alpha), you need a little bit longer to get your head into a domain and have time to play around making scrappy prototypes. For build work, a two-week sprint isnâ€™t really two weeks. With all the ceremonies required for co-ordination and sharing information â€“ which is a lot more labour-intensive in remote-first settings â€“ you lose a couple of days with two-week sprints.</p><p>Sprint goals suck too. Itâ€™s far too easy to push it along and limp from fortnight to fortnight, never really considering whether you should stop the workstream. Itâ€™s better to think about your appetite for doing something, and then to focus on getting valuable iterations out there rather than committing to a whole thing.</p><p>Iâ€™m not describing this in detail because the team will likely write about it after a few months of trying out the new model, and itâ€™s very specific to this team and its context. However, thereâ€™s a few principles that are essential:</p><ul><li>Fixed time, variable scope</li><li>Think in iterations: vertical not horizontal slices</li><li>Each cycle ends with something shippable or showable</li><li>R&amp;D cycles end on decisions around scope</li><li>Each cycle starts with a brief, but the team can deliver it how they like</li></ul><p>Iâ€™m pretty confident in these principles. It worked at GOV.â€ŒUK Pay and the startup. Key enabling conditions are experienced people who are empowered and passionate about the mission, but Iâ€™m lucky to have worked on teams made up of people like that.</p><h2 id="firebreaks-for-team-culture">Firebreaks for team culture</h2><p>Traditionally, a <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/03/firebreaks-on-gov-uk/">firebreak</a> is an opportunity to have some self-directed time to improve your product or service any way you want. I always really enjoyed them, itâ€™s a chance to flex the creative muscles and scratch an itch.</p><p>The only problem is that youâ€™re still working on your product or service, and you do that all the time anyway. Iâ€™m a big believer in putting time and effort into team culture, feeding the vibes: itâ€™s the work that makes the work <em>work</em>. Iâ€™m also starting to create more opportunities for teams to play together, because it recharges the batteries and builds trust.</p><p>So I thought, hey, what if we spend a week playing around on team culture bits?</p><p>The culture problem staring me in the face was â€˜hybrid-workingâ€™. Hybrid-working is bullshit, if you ask me. Itâ€™s this sitting-on-the-fence middle ground where you donâ€™t have to declare any opinions about how people should work or how to optimise the conditions for good work to happen. Instead, you should call yourself remote-first, define when in-office collaboration is necessary, and optimise everything else to factor in geographic distribution and asynchronous communication. (Iâ€™ve written about <a href="/2020/11/02/free-range-future-of-work">free-range working</a> before but should write something else.)</p><p>Anyway, one symptom of hybrid-working and not optimising conditions is that you havenâ€™t tuned your team culture around this. In the Before Times, we lived and breathed team culture through ambient media and shared spaces. Weâ€™d put posters up on the wall. Weâ€™d huddle around a TV during standup. Weâ€™d stick things on our desks, and weâ€™d scribble on whiteboards as part of our work.</p><p>But that all happens inside tools now. Those tools look different for each person on the team, and thereâ€™s no personalisation. The sense of team unity and having a shared space becomes fractured.</p><p>So several weeks ago I asked the team what we might do to rekindle that sense of unity in a way that embraces <del>hybrid</del> remote-first working. They came up with tons of ideas which all looked grand.</p><p>Off the back of those, I wrote a brief for the firebreak: â€˜Create a warm, informative and engaging onboarding experience for new team members.â€™ I planned a basic firebreak around that which allows people to remix and combine ideas, then split off into teams to work on their projects. And instead of â€˜firebreakâ€™ weâ€™ve been calling it â€˜creative jam weekâ€™ â€“ <a href="/2023/09/18/jam-together">jam together</a> and have fun!</p><p>On Thursday we had a show &amp; tell and the team came up with some blindingly good answers to the brief.</p><ul><li>Team avatars that go beyond Manual of Me, emphasising the person over the work persona</li><li>A timeline of the design system, why it exists and how we got here (with scope for design history and weeknotes)</li><li>A box of stickers, posters, pamphlets and handwritten notes to welcome new joiners and make them feel a part of the crew</li></ul><p>The beauty of what they came up with is that it combines elements of virtual realities, tangible things, shared identities, plus synchronous and asynchronous timelines.</p><p>Not only will the team be able to welcome new joiners and make them feel at home, theyâ€™ve also created some stuff that brings them all closer together.</p><p>Feed the vibes. Let people jam together.</p><h2 id="running">Running</h2><p>This has fallen off a cliff. Likely because I donâ€™t have a goal and, to be honest, Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™ll work out a light schedule thatâ€™ll maintain fitness for the half-marathon in February, but I need a summer goal to build up to. Iâ€™ll make a plan for running between the bothies in Eryri.</p><h2 id="paris">Paris</h2><p>We didnâ€™t have a bad meal in Paris â€“ except a cold hot dog at La Defense Arena watching Harlequins beat Racing 92 â€“ so hereâ€™s all the places we went that you should try too.</p><ul><li>CafÃ© Les Deux Gares, 2 Rue des Deux Gares</li><li>Le Cadoret, 1 Rue Pradier</li><li>Bouche, 85 Rue Jean-Pierre Timbaud</li><li>Williâ€™s Wine Bar, 13 Rue des Petits Champs</li></ul><h2 id="bookmarks">Bookmarks</h2><ul><li><a href="http://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/14/ai-trust-crisis/#atom-everything">The AI trust crisis</a>, 7 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0fec3572-1186-4c45-88df-221243ee9997">As God is my witness, gluttony is not a sin</a>, 9 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c7731011-f59d-44d8-94c4-02057385de51">Does the Enlightenment still matter?</a>, 8 mins</li><li><a href="https://scifiinterfaces.com/2023/12/11/hackers/">Hackers (1995)</a>, 15 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.decanter.com/features/a-day-in-the-life-with-mark-williamson-248880/">A day in the life with Mark Williamson</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/how-an-english-upstart-changed-parisian-wine-bars-for-ever-1.4654322">How an English upstart changed Parisian wine bars â€˜for everâ€™</a>, 4 mins</li><li><a href="https://benholliday.com/2023/11/28/hold-it-lightly/">Hold it lightly</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://on.ft.com/3RxMlkD">The economics of chicken-shop Britain</a>, 9 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.dxw.com/2023/12/service-delivery-is-broken-its-time-to-join-it-up/">Service delivery is broken â€“ itâ€™s time to join it up</a>, 6 mins</li><li><a href="https://on.ft.com/41aHGIx">What Kwasi Kwarteng knows now</a>, 3 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.svpg.com/alternatives-to-product-leaders/?trk=feed_main-feed-card_reshare_feed-article-content">Alternatives To Product Leaders</a>, 6 mins</li><li><a href="https://benholliday.com/2023/12/03/an-example-of-good-ux-not-being-good-enough/">An example of â€˜goodâ€™ UX not being good enough</a>, 4 mins</li><li><a href="https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/2023-12-03/">Loss</a>, 2 mins</li><li><a href="https://whitehallwebby.com/2023/12/01/weeknote-zero-day-one/">Weeknote zero, day one</a>, 2 mins</li><li><a href="https://flocrivello.com/you-must-fuck-around-and-find-out/">You Must Fuck Around and Find Out</a>, 2 mins</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/11/30/trump-dictator-2024-election-robert-kagan/">Opinion A Trump dictatorship is increasingly inevitable.
